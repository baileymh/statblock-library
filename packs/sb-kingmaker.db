This ability functions exactly like <i>false life</i> (CL 7th) but lasts only 1 hour. </p><p><strong>Verdant Step (Su)</strong> Every stride taken by a blodeuwedd causes small plants, grasses, and wildflowers to sprout from the ground, though she can suppress this effect if she desires. While within a plain of tall grass, brush, or similar undergrowth, a blodeuwedd may also step through such plant-life and emerge at any other point within the same field (potentially miles away). This ability functions similar to <i>transport via plants</i>, but a blodeuwedd can only transport herself and does not require a plant equal to her size. This ability is usable three times per day. </p><p><strong>Wild Empathy (Ex)</strong> This works like the druid's wild empathy class feature, except a blodeuwedd has a +6 racial bonus on the check. A blodeuwedd with druid levels adds this racial modifier to her wild empathy checks.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>The mysterious blodeuwedds stand apart from dryads, their tree-bound sisters of the forest, instead watching over the open plains and prairies. They frequently guard the approaches to primeval, fey enclaves as well as various gateways and entry points into the First World-a task they take very seriously. Blodeuwedds hide such regions behind veils of illusion and trickery, quietly observing anyone passing through their lands, and occasionally sending mysterious messages to warn them away or to summon allies that can drive them out. Even when not standing sentinel over a point of otherworldly importance, blodeuwedds find spots of particular natural beauty, transforming such fields-usually only a few acres in size-into sites of unearthly lushness and natural wonder. A typical blodeuwedd stands a little over 5 feet tall, weighs 120 pounds, and may live up to 800 years.<strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p> Instead of developing a lifelong bond with trees, blodeuwedds hold an affinity for open grasslands, moors, and plains. They survive off the land, taking nourishment from all that nature provides, while also looking after prairie animals in times of drought or lean winters. Unlike dryads, blodeuwedds have no dependency on the plants around them; they can willingly leave their chosen moor to visit their fey kin, scout their domain in owl form, or even mingle with frontier communities, changing shape to appear elven or human. Every 15 or so years, blodeuwedds may reproduce through a natural ritual of fertility known as the Blooming, a process by which they commune with the adopted plants of their surrounding field. At the height of the spring season, they then exchange pollen with every flower within 300 yards, a complicated and sensuous act that eventually allows a blodeuwedd to conceive. It takes 6 months to carry a new blodeuwedd to term, and they frequently come together to act as midwives during this time to ensure successful deliveries for one another. Some tales tell of blodeuwedds displaced from their homes or in captivity capable of performing the Blooming by drawing off the lifeforce of amorous men, ending in the withering death of the would-be father. Such legends give blodeuwedds a reputation for being dangerous seductresses in some regions. Blodeuwedds typically establish their own prairie holdings within 7 miles of each other for mutual support and ease of communication.<strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p> Blodeuwedds make their homes out of sod, carving them from the landscape and then encouraging prairie grass to grow over the exterior to hide them. These elaborate structures resemble small rises and hillocks that overlook ley lines and fairy paths between sites of great power and importance to the fey, which the blodeuwedds jealously guard from nonfey creatures. Most fey recognize such service by referring to blodeuwedds with honorific titles meant to curry their favor. As a result, many blodeuwedds set themselves up as queens or wardens to receive tribute from favored kin who pass through their realms. Blodeuwedds also rely on <i>plant growth</i> and their ability to <i>speak with plants</i> to manage the surrounding fields, encouraging them to grow into complex mazes of hedgerows, tangles, and thickets to better shape their territory. Often they use <i>hallucinatory terrain</i> to hide the best routes through these areas. Interlopers typically find themselves impeded by <i>entangle</i> or areas of <i>spike growth</i> when they enter a blodeuwedd's territory. Any who persist then become targeted by <i>deep slumber</i> or <i>modify memory</i> to lead them in false directions. More rarely, a blodeuwedd might aid one on an important quest, but she usually requires some form of guarantee before agreeing to do so. All blodeuwedds possess tremendous knowledge of and influence over the lands and creatures that border their fields. They often involve themselves in the politics of elves, gnomes, and humans who live nearby-even if only to warn against destructive trespasses or wasteful farming practices. They enjoy playing wind flutes, dancing under the stars, and chasing one another's fairy lights like fireflies among the tall grass. Blodeuwedd Queens Particularly old and active blodeuwedds- typically the eldest within a region that more than 10 blodeuwedds inhabit-sometimes ascend to the status of queens, gaining additional power and prestige among their own kind. They develop a greater affinity for the lands they rule and attract even more followers. The following adjustments to a standard blodeuwedd represent a young blodeuwedd queen at CR 8.

As soon as it becomes apparent that he'll soon be in melee, he casts <i>divine favor</i>. Whenever possible, he uses Channel Smite to further empower his blows with negative energy. If enemies look like they're about to reach him, he casts <i>control <i>water</i></i> to cause the <i>water</i> level in this area to rise, flooding the entire cavern for 1 round before rushing out into the other caves. On that initial round, anyone who makes a DC 20 Swim check resists the sudden current-all others are knocked prone and washed into area N10, N11, or N13 (whichever is closest). Thereafter, the <i>water</i> level in the caves stabilizes at a depth of 1 foot (meaningless to boggards with their swamp stride ability). This tactic immediately disperses any insect swarms still in the area, but it should give Sepoko a chance to disrupt the PCs' tactics quite well.</p><p><strong>Morale </strong>If reduced to 35 hit points or fewer, Sepoko's remaining faith in Gogunta shatters and he drops to his knees and croaks out a prayer to the Legless Lady to save him and smite the intruders. Of course, no divine intervention comes (although Sepoko immediately loses access to all of his spells and cleric abilities), and any surviving boggards who witness this failure realize that their leader has fallen. Amid a sudden chorus of \"Kill the heretic!\" in Boggard, the remaining boggards forget about the PCs' presence and swarm forward, eager to tear Sepoko limb from limb in hopes of showing Gogunta, who must surely be watching, that they still fear her.</p></div><hr /><div><p><strong>STATISTICS</strong></p></div><hr /><div><p><strong>Str </strong>12, <strong>Dex </strong>10, <strong>Con </strong>18, <strong>Int </strong> 8, <strong>Wis </strong>18, <strong>Cha </strong>13</p><p><strong>Base Atk </strong>+9; <strong>CMB </strong>+10; <strong>CMD </strong>21</p><p><strong>Feats </strong>Brew Potion, Channel Smite, Craft Wand, Extra Channel, Lightning Reflexes, Toughness, Weapon Focus (morningstar)</p><p><strong>Skills </strong>Handle Animal +7, Intimidate +4, Knowledge (religion) +6, Swim +10</p><p><strong>Languages </strong>Boggard</p><p><strong>SQ </strong>hold breath, swamp stride</p><p><strong>Combat Gear </strong><i>potions of <i>cure moderate wounds</i></i> (3), <i>potion of sanctuary</i>, <i>wand of <i>cure moderate wounds</i></i> (24 charges), <i>wand of poison</i> (9 charges); <strong>Other Gear </strong><i>+2 hide armor</i>, <i>+1 icy morningstar</i>, masterwork light wooden shield, spell component pouch, unholy symbol of Gogunta</p></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Kingmaker.jpg","_id":"Ar8jlQwVja2c4jkO"}

Each time a creature takes damage from a verdurous ooze's acid, the creature's metal equipment and armor take the same amount of damage from the acid. A DC 21 Reflex save prevents damage to such items. A metal or natural weapon that strikes a verdurous ooze takes 1d6 points of acid damage unless the weapon's wielder succeeds on a DC 21 Reflex save. If a verdurous ooze remains in contact with a metal object for 1 full round, it inflicts 20 points of acid damage (no save) on the object. The save DCs are Constitution-based. </p><p><strong>Enliven (Sp)</strong> The chemicals emitted by a verdurous ooze cause nearby plants to twitch into life. While in areas covered in natural growth, all squares within 15 feet of the verdurous ooze are affected as if by the spell <i>entangle.</i> The verdurous ooze has no control over this effect, and if dispelled the effect renews after 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based. </p><p><strong>Sleep Aura (Su)</strong> The chemicals emitted by a verdurous ooze have a stronger and opposite effect on living, non-plant creatures that come within a 30-foot radius. All living creatures within the area must make a DC 21 Will save or fall asleep for a number of rounds equal to the ooze's HD. Creatures immune to poison are also immune to this effect. Whether or not the save is successful, that creature cannot be affected again by the same verdurous ooze's sleep aura for 24 hours. This is a nonmagical sleep effect. The save DC is Constitution-based. </p><p><strong>Split (Ex)</strong> Slashing and piercing weapons deal no damage to a verdurous ooze. Instead, if the verdurous ooze would have taken 10 or more points of damage from a single slashing or piercing attack, it splits into two identical oozes, each with half of the original's current hit points (round down). Slashing or piercing attacks that deal less than 10 points of damage do not cause a verdurous ooze to split. Damage from multiple slashing or piercing attacks is not cumulative. A verdurous ooze with 15 hit points or less cannot be further split and dies if reduced to 0 hit points.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Verdurous oozes are animate masses of protoplasm of a sickly green hue. At rest, their flat bodies stand roughly 5 inches tall and can stretch out to a wide diameter, their surfaces blossoming into what look like thick tangles of mossy roots and gnarled vegetation as they lie still. Known to emit invisible but dangerous chemicals, these masses of slinking muck cause nearby plants to writhe and coil as if alive, while shocking animals into a temporary but deathly torpor. As such, they rarely must hunt to find food, instead sensing passing creatures and preying upon them after they succumb to the oozes' sleep aura. Always ravenous, the powerful acids that comprise these oozes quickly dissolve the flesh of their meals. A verdurous ooze typically weighs 300 pounds and can easily spread to fill a 5-foot-square area. While moving, such crawling muck rises only a few inches tall, though its structure might grow and boil up to a height of 2 or 3 feet if let undisturbed for a matter of days. Spontaneously grown structures collapse and melt back into the ooze's body as soon as it begins moving again.<strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p> Verdurous oozes settle in locations with abundant food, rarely moving far except to feed upon comatose prey that has come too close or to reproduce. Verdurous oozes primarily gain sustenance from the small birds, mammals, and insects that fall prey to their sleep aura, but also prove well suited to devouring larger creatures that fall asleep nearby. Every 2 or 3 years, verdurous oozes collect deep in forests and swamps, clustering in secluded locales tainted by reeking natural compost or the escape of natural gases from the land. As many as 10 oozes might gather during one of these grotesque moots. To reproduce, four verdurous oozes merge to become a greater verdurous ooze. Greater oozes are far more active and hungry than their lesser kin, constantly wandering, feeding, and growing. After several months, the greater verdurous ooze splits into 10 to 15 new verdurous oozes. These new verdurous oozes grow to full size within 6 months.<strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p> Verdurous oozes primarily live in temperate forests and plains among high grasses or cultivated crops, though they might also be found in warm plains and jungle environments. As mindless creatures, they pay little attention to others of their kind, save when drawn to reproduce. A notable fact about verdurous oozes is that they beneficially impact nearby plant life; their secretions act as a kind of natural fertilizer. Trees, grass, flowers-all flora benefits from the existence of a nearby verdurous ooze. Over time, this can lead to an increase in the fauna in the area, as they seek to enjoy the rich, lush plants that make up their diet and in turn become prey for the stealthy ooze. Thus, another sign that a verdurous ooze is, or has been, in a particular area is the skeletons of animals that it has consumed, which are left behind once the flesh has been absorbed. Resourceful evil humanoids sometimes take advantage of verdurous oozes' relative lassitude and difficultly escaping from simple pits or other containers, trapping them near the entrances to their lairs. In such instances, the oozes' chemical secretions provide an extra defense for those aware of their presence and the dangers of coming too close.<br /><strong>Greater Verdurous Ooze </strong><br />Greater verdurous oozes are formed when several green oozes merge together as part of their reproductive process. They are similar in form but much larger, and while still green, exhibit white and red lines that resemble veins running through them. They are even more voracious and dangerous than standard green oozes, as they eat and eat to gain enough mass to reproduce. A greater verdurous ooze typically weighs 2,400 pounds and can easily spread to fill a 10-foot-square area.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Kingmaker.jpg","_id":"B579btsEwnFA3PgO"}

A gastrolith that misses its target hits a nearby point, just like a normal miss with a splash weapon, as detailed on page 202 of the <i>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook.</i> An irlgaunt has a separate orifice for ejecting gastroliths. Thus, it can make a ranged attack in addition to all its normal melee attacks. </p><p><strong>Stone Step (Ex)</strong> An irlgaunt can move through any sort of natural difficult terrain at its normal speed while in rocky or subterranean terrain. Magically altered terrain affects an irlgaunt as normal.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Irlgaunts are large, spider-like aberrations that lurk in mountainous regions and vertical subterranean chasms. While large and imposing, these arachnid-like beings are deceivingly agile, their reflexes fast and movements swift, similar to the darting motions of a hunting insect. Irlgaunts are as quick-witted as they are nimble and have a strong grasp of strategy and tactics. In Iobaria, the beasts are recognized for their eerily patient predations, hiding amid jagged rocks to attack prey and ejecting crippling blasts of rock and digestive acids upon their victims. Irlgaunts typically attack travelers scaling mountain paths with steep cliff sides, using the hazardous terrain to knock unstable hikers to their death, then skittering down the sheer cliff faces to lap up the fleshy pulp below. Most irlgaunts stand between 11 and 13 feet tall and weigh around 3,000 pounds.<strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p> Irlgaunts are powerful carnivores that eat most things but seem to have a strong preference for the taste of humanoids and mountain rams, taking special enjoyment in the consumption of bone, horn, and marrow. An irlgaunt's gizzard, located near its upper orifice, is powerful enough to grind rock, creating shards of stone which the creature fires from its mouth. The resulting stone shards are combined into gastroliths- sizable, dense spheres of sharp stones veined with jellified digestive acids. These gastroliths not only help the creature grind apart the hard substances it digests, but also can be shot forth as weapons, felling and pre-digesting sizable or even flying prey. Gastroliths are under constant pressure within an irlgaunt's body and, once shot forth, prove quite fragile. Upon impacting a victim or any other surface, they shatter in a rain of rock shards and hissing acid. Irlgaunts are found on and around mountains, especially near narrow trails used by travelers, mountain dwellers, or herds of sure-footed animals. The rocky environment they inhabit matches the colors of their bodies, and their uncanny ability to blend into the terrain and attack from unexpected angles makes them skilled ambush hunters. The tough limbs of an irlgaunt end in nimble, muscular tendrils. Along with being able to seek out and cling to nearly imperceptible flaws in stone, these tendrils also secrete a potent, stone-digesting acid much like that found within the beasts' gizzards. This acid allows irlgaunts not only to burn holes into solid stone, but to shape stone into whatever form they desire. Irlgaunts live for up to 300 years and reproduce asexually every half-century. They take special care to protect their offspring for this reason and watch over them for about a year, at which point the adolescent reaches maturity.<strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p> Irlgaunts are not particularly social creatures, but they work together when doing so is mutually beneficial. In smaller numbers, irlgaunts are more likely to live in more remote areas, while larger groups may occupy more commonly traveled mountain passes. Irlgaunts sometimes share their habitat with giants native to the region, but do so through an unspoken truce that holds little weight. A single giant walking through an area of several irlgaunts, then, is no safer than a solitary irlgaunt prowling a region populated with giants. Yet neither group goes out of its way to provoke a dangerous feud with its powerful, mountain dwelling neighbors- as long as the other group is generally content to stay out of the way. Treasure means little to irlgaunts, though if they possess a relic or magic item, they use it as bait for sentient wanderers in the region. For this reason, particularly wealthy and well-guarded travelers or merchants may be able to parley with the aberrations, exchanging riches for safe passage. Irlgaunts are largely indifferent to religion. However, some spiritually inclined irlgaunts choose to follow Rovagug, and some even become priests in his name. In such cases, a group or family of irlgaunts tend to worship the same god. Those rare irlgaunts that do worship Rovagug often take an almost personal interest in freeing the imprisoned god, delving deep into the earth and creating new abysses covered in profane images and symbols of the monstrous deity. The hope seems to be that should enough cracks be cut into the depths, Rovagug's prison deep beneath the surface might weaken enough for the god of destruction to break free. The futility of such efforts seems to matter little to the aberrations, which appear to care more about the symbolism of their destructive actions.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Kingmaker.jpg","_id":"BRG2xxsAtjMshF2c"}

Its slams count as natural weapons or manufactured weapons (whichever is most beneficial to it) for the purpose of spells that enhance attacks. Its attacks count as adamantine, chaos, and magic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. </p><p><strong>Breathless (Ex)</strong> Unlike most outsiders, the First Blade does not need to breathe. </p><p><strong>Ever Armed (Su)</strong> As a swift action, at will, the First Blade can cause a mundane melee weapon of any type or size to appear in its hands. Although it typically battles unarmed, it sometimes makes use of weapons as needed. These weapons come from Gorum's divine realm, and this ability cannot be used to claim a specific weapon. </p><p><strong>Heavy Fortification (Ex)</strong> The First Blade has a 75% chance to treat a critical hit or sneak attack as a normal attack, as if it were wearing <i>heavy fortification</i> armor. </p><p><strong>Immunity to Magic (Ex)</strong> The First Blade is immune to spells or spell-like abilities that allow spell resistance. The First Blade can lower this resistance for 1 round as a standard action (similar to a creature with spell resistance lowering its spell resistance) to allow other creatures to cast spells on it; it can use its spell-like abilities on itself without difficulty. Certain spells and effects function differently against it, as noted below. • A magical attack that deals electricity damage <i>slow</i>s the First Blade (as the <i>slow</i> spell) for 1 round, with no saving throw. • A magical attack that deals fire damage breaks any <i>slow</i> effect on the First Blade and heals 1 point of damage for each 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the First Blade to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points. The First Blade gets no saving throw against fire effects. • The First Blade is affected normally by rust attacks, such as those of a rust monster or a <i>rusting grasp</i> spell. </p><p><strong>Ironsense (Ex)</strong> The First Blade automatically detects iron objects (including steel) within 60 feet, just as if it possessed the blindsight ability. </p><p><strong>Lord of Battle (Ex)</strong> The First Blade is treated as an 18th-level barbarian and fighter for any game rule (such as a feat prerequisite) that requires levels in barbarian or fighter. It is proficient in all weapons. </p><p><strong>Powerful Blows (Ex)</strong> The First Blade inflicts one and a half times its Strength modifier and threatens a critical hit on a 19-20 with its slam attacks. </p><p><strong>Rage Aura (Su)</strong> Willing creatures within 100 feet of the First Blade gain the effects of a <i>rage</i> spell automatically, whether they are allies or enemies of the Herald. Those who choose not to be affected are immune to the aura until they leave the area and return (at which point they may again accept or refuse the aura's effect). </p><p><strong>Swarm Form (Su)</strong> The First Blade can shift between its manlike body and a floating swarm of Diminutive and Tiny sharp metal fragments as a standard action. In swarm form it has the swarm subtype; it cannot use its slam attacks but instead can make a swarm attack (4d6 and distraction). Though its individual components may float up to 10 feet above the ground as they move, the Blade's swarm form cannot fly. The First Blade remains in one form until it chooses to assume its other form. A change in form cannot be dispelled, nor does the First Blade revert to any particular form when killed (both shapes are its true form). A <i>true seeing</i> spell reveals both forms simultaneously.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Said to have been formed from an unthinking sliver of steel dashed from Gorum's blade during one of his first clashes with a long-felled god-beast of the Outer Sphere, the First Blade is a living tool of war. Inspired by Gorum's divine bloodlust, this shard of the god of battle's blade continues to obey and do battle in the service of its divine master. Having been reforged through the eons into a manifestation of Gorum's perfect warrior, the First Blade serves as the war god's herald, traveling where its master desires. Yet while the heralds of most deities go forth to bear the word of their divine patrons or answer the most desperate summons of their gods' most pious servants, the First Blade endlessly marches to battle. Never interested in diplomacy or subtlety, Gorum has little need for a messenger other than one capable of communicating in the language of the battlefield. The god of battle answers the calls only of those who please him in battle and request his heralds' aid in epic clashes dedicated to his honor- weakling priests seeking salvation or cowardly revenge never have their entreaties for the herald's presence answered. The appearance of the First Blade changes to match a style of armor impressive to those against whom it will be doing battle, though typically notched as if it has been employed in numerous battles. Rarely seen in the same form twice, its plate mail form might vary from the elegant mail of angelic hosts to slabs of spiked iron over thick bestial hides more common to orc warlords. Whatever the shape, the interior of the armor is never visible. Those who have come close enough to the First Blade and survived claim that only more layers of armor lie beneath its plates, though the hint of something glowing within sometimes spills forth should the herald suffer a rare but occasional wound. Regardless of the specifics of its warlike form, the herald of Gorum typically stands about 15 feet tall and weighs nearly 2 tons.<strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p> Although a living creature, the First Blade is little more than a weapon of Gorum, knowing little beyond its lord's command and going only where he wills. Like a golem in many respects, the herald leaves but scant traces upon the lands it passes through between battles, eating little and having no need even to breathe. In war, however, its presence and passage are obvious, marked by rent bodies and blood-soaked earth. Although the First Blade can speak a variety of languages, few of those encountering the herald have heard it do so. Like its master, the First Blade prefers actions-especially violent, purposeful ones-to words. Typically its words are brief refutations of those who have summoned it for an unfit purpose, though several legends tell of the divine messenger offering its respect or the pleasure of its master before striking the final blow upon an opponent who has put up a particularly capable fight or proven her prowess on the field of battle.<strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p> While the herald of Gorum answers the call of servants of the lord of battle who seek their lord's intervention in appropriately glorious battle, no accounts exist of the First Blade responding to any summons involving a task other than combat. Most accounts of the herald tell of the gory swaths it cuts through battlefields of heroes, in clashes between titanic armies, or in weeks-long battles between history's greatest warlords. Rumors among Gorum's clergy also suggest that sometimes the herald appears when summoned to a lesser battle, but upon finding a mere skirmish or clash among weaklings, it slaughters all involved. Whether such an end is an honor or a disgrace for those killed remains a subject of some debate among theologians.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Kingmaker.jpg","_id":"CMJW39sJU4yZXNBj"}

Each time a creature takes damage from the ooze's acid, its metal equipment and armor take the same amount of damage from the acid. A DC 25 Reflex save prevents damage to such items. A metal or natural weapon that strikes a greater verdurous ooze takes 1d8 points of acid damage unless the weapon's wielder succeeds on a DC 25 Reflex save. If a greater verdurous ooze remains in contact with a metal object for 1 full round, it inflicts 25 points of acid damage (no save) on the object. The save DCs are Constitution-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Verdurous oozes are animate masses of protoplasm of a sickly green hue. At rest, their flat bodies stand roughly 5 inches tall and can stretch out to a wide diameter, their surfaces blossoming into what look like thick tangles of mossy roots and gnarled vegetation as they lie still. Known to emit invisible but dangerous chemicals, these masses of slinking muck cause nearby plants to writhe and coil as if alive, while shocking animals into a temporary but deathly torpor. As such, they rarely must hunt to find food, instead sensing passing creatures and preying upon them after they succumb to the oozes' sleep aura. Always ravenous, the powerful acids that comprise these oozes quickly dissolve the flesh of their meals. A verdurous ooze typically weighs 300 pounds and can easily spread to fill a 5-foot-square area. While moving, such crawling muck rises only a few inches tall, though its structure might grow and boil up to a height of 2 or 3 feet if let undisturbed for a matter of days. Spontaneously grown structures collapse and melt back into the ooze's body as soon as it begins moving again.<strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p> Verdurous oozes settle in locations with abundant food, rarely moving far except to feed upon comatose prey that has come too close or to reproduce. Verdurous oozes primarily gain sustenance from the small birds, mammals, and insects that fall prey to their sleep aura, but also prove well suited to devouring larger creatures that fall asleep nearby. Every 2 or 3 years, verdurous oozes collect deep in forests and swamps, clustering in secluded locales tainted by reeking natural compost or the escape of natural gases from the land. As many as 10 oozes might gather during one of these grotesque moots. To reproduce, four verdurous oozes merge to become a greater verdurous ooze. Greater oozes are far more active and hungry than their lesser kin, constantly wandering, feeding, and growing. After several months, the greater verdurous ooze splits into 10 to 15 new verdurous oozes. These new verdurous oozes grow to full size within 6 months.<strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p> Verdurous oozes primarily live in temperate forests and plains among high grasses or cultivated crops, though they might also be found in warm plains and jungle environments. As mindless creatures, they pay little attention to others of their kind, save when drawn to reproduce. A notable fact about verdurous oozes is that they beneficially impact nearby plant life; their secretions act as a kind of natural fertilizer. Trees, grass, flowers-all flora benefits from the existence of a nearby verdurous ooze. Over time, this can lead to an increase in the fauna in the area, as they seek to enjoy the rich, lush plants that make up their diet and in turn become prey for the stealthy ooze. Thus, another sign that a verdurous ooze is, or has been, in a particular area is the skeletons of animals that it has consumed, which are left behind once the flesh has been absorbed. Resourceful evil humanoids sometimes take advantage of verdurous oozes' relative lassitude and difficultly escaping from simple pits or other containers, trapping them near the entrances to their lairs. In such instances, the oozes' chemical secretions provide an extra defense for those aware of their presence and the dangers of coming too close.<br /><strong>Greater Verdurous Ooze </strong><br />Greater verdurous oozes are formed when several green oozes merge together as part of their reproductive process. They are similar in form but much larger, and while still green, exhibit white and red lines that resemble veins running through them. They are even more voracious and dangerous than standard green oozes, as they eat and eat to gain enough mass to reproduce. A greater verdurous ooze typically weighs 2,400 pounds and can easily spread to fill a 10-foot-square area.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Kingmaker.jpg","_id":"DaenA2WsRwGAzMLX"}

If it succeeds on a ranged touch attack, the mudman immediately makes a CMB check to grapple the target (this does not provoke an attack of opportunity) with a +4 racial bonus. If the mudman fails to establish a hold, it drops into an adjacent square and is staggered for 1 round. If the mudman establishes a hold, it flows over its opponent, covering the creature with its muddy body-it can attempt a new CMB check to maintain the \"hold\" on the creature each round that follows as a free action. The creature is effectively blinded and must either hold its breath or suffocate as long as the mudman retains its hold. Each round the mudman maintains its hold, it deals 1d4+3 points of damage as it crushes and constricts its victims. </p><p><strong>Magic Vulnerability (Ex)</strong> Mudmen are particularly susceptible to <i>dispel magic</i>, as this spell disrupts the magical energies in their bodies. A mudman subjected to <i>dispel magic</i> takes 1d6 points of damage per caster level (Fortitude save for half damage). Transmute mud to rock deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level to any mudmen caught in the area of effect and leaves them staggered until they can find a new mud pool. Other, similar spells may have similar effects. </p><p><strong>Mud Bomb (Su)</strong> A mudman can hurl globs of its muddy body mixed with its surrounding mud-this attack has a range increment of 10 feet. If one of these mud bombs hits a target, it quickly grows semi-solid and tenacious, causing 1d4 points of Dexterity damage. If the cumulative Dexterity damage from mud bombs ever equals the target's actual Dexterity score, the target remains conscious but is held immobile and cannot take any physical action (although see below) until the mud is removed or the target breaks free. Spell-like abilities or spells with only verbal components may be used if the trapped creature can make a DC 20 concentration check. It's a DC 20 Strength check (made as a full-round action) to pry accumulated mud off and remove all Dexterity damage caused by the attack-a creature that is held immobile can break free with a DC 25 Strength check made as a full-round action (this is the only physical action the creature can attempt while encased in mud). The mud dries and crumbles to dust in 15 minutes, or in 1d3 rounds if a large amount of water (such as results from a casting of create water) is used to wash it away. </p><p><strong>Mud Pool (Su)</strong> A mudman cannot leave the bounds of the mud pool it dwells in, although these mud pools may be of any size. A mudman's tremorsense extends throughout the entire mud pool, and it gains a +16 bonus on Stealth checks when hiding in a mud pool. A mudman forced out of its mud pool is staggered.</p></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Kingmaker.jpg","_id":"EokoAxRQXVVcQuPi"}

They sail like boats, driven before the wind and using their feathers to tack and turn. They sing as they fly, jabbering and chirping to each other in complex harmonies. The average skrik nettle shoal consists of three dozen or more of the majestic creatures, but these flocks are often split up during the roaring storms so common to the First World. Lone skrik nettles may be encountered in smaller numbers, confused and trying to find their way back to their kin. Skrik nettles range in size from a few inches across (for a newly spawned hatchling) to the size of gigantic, scintillating clouds. Most, however, are no more than 8 or 9 feet across.<strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p> Skrik nettles are primarily scavengers, although they will attack suitable prey when hungry. Their method of attack is curious. The sharp beaks of a skrik nettle drip with a magical poison that is injected when the creature bites a foe. The victim of the poison feels slightly nauseous and light-headed at first-and then begins to float off the ground. As long as the poison pumps through the veins of the skrik nettle's victim, the victim keeps floating up into the sky. The victim has no control over this magical levitation-unless she has some other method of controlling her flight, such as wings or magic, or she can grab a convenient tree branch, she will keep ascending until the poison wears off and gravity takes hold once more. The skrik nettles usually float up alongside their prey, keeping it floating by injecting more poison as soon as it starts to drop. Especially dangerous or hardshelled prey might be poisoned, allowed to rise, and then dropped repeatedly from a height until dead. The poison's effects seem to be rooted in magic, rather than venom, and dispelling the ailment has proven to be just as effective as bleeding a victim. Before aiding a victim, however, one must take caution to tie said creature down securely, as there are few deaths more ironic than being cured of a skrik nettle's poison only to instantly plunge to earth from a great height. Oddly, in addition to traditional remedies, killing a skrik nettle also instantly cancels the effects of its poison. Once every year, skrik nettles return to their shoal's spawning grounds to reproduce. The jellyfish-like creatures form hard, rugged eggs inside their bodies, then float gently down to the spawning ground-usually a jungle clearing or warm swamp-and dig nests with their tentacles. Skrik nettles are hermaphrodites, so each one lays its eggs and then fertilizes those of its neighbor (this cross-breeding strengthens future generations of skrik nettles). The average skrik nettle lays three or four eggs, whose size ranges from that of a clenched fist to that of a giant's skull. These eggs incubate in the warm earth for several days, during which time the skrik nettles patrol above the spawning ground, attacking anyone who might disturb the eggs. When ready to hatch, the eggs explode out of the ground and shoot into the sky, bursting into a swarm of newborn skrik nettles. Unwary travelers who slip past the patrolling skrik nettles can trigger a premature hatching if they walk over the spawning ground; such travelers may be pummeled by flying, rock-hard egg shards, or even carried into the sky by a particularly large hatchling. Hatchling skrik nettles are ravenously hungry when born. To provide for the needs of their young, skrik nettle shoals assemble caches of poisoned meat and float them over the spawning ground. A wary explorer can spot a spawning ground from afar if she notices rotting corpses hanging overhead. Skrik nettle eggs can often be sold to the fey. Some train young skrik nettles as songbirds, teaching all six beaks to sing in harmony. Others wrap skrik nettle eggs in cloth filled with golden dust or brightly colored pollen; when an egg prepared in such a manner flies into the sky and explodes upon hatching, the cloth's contents scatter across the sky like a beautiful firework. Such entertainments are popular at parties-though the ensuing swarm of carnivorous jellyfish swooping down on the guests is considered less enchanting.<strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p> Skrik nettles dwell amid the clouds, descending only to feed and procreate. They use their songs to keep the shoal together, flying toward the chirping music of their kin. Bards are often able to lure skrik nettles down to them with their enchanting melodies, but once within range, the poisonous creatures usually trade this performance for a live meal. Skrik nettles are not especially intelligent predators- thus, they eat the bounty of the land, or, if particularly lucky, snatch a dead or weak creature from the ground. While skittish, they retaliate when attacked, regarding the assault as a chance to feed. Settlements in regions where skrik nettle migrations are common usually keep a few sacrificial animals handy to lure the skrik nettles away during a hunt. The one exception is where the skrik nettle's spawning grounds are involved-during the time before a hatching, the skrik nettle shoal patrols the area around the spawning grounds and viciously attacks any trespassers. Skrik nettles are also a hazard to flyers. They lurk in low-hanging clouds, letting their tendrils trail down out of the mist. An unwary bird or flying creature can be stung, grabbed, and whisked off to be eaten in a matter of seconds. When scavenging, they fly at a low level above the landscape, letting their tendrils play over the ground as they search for carrion. Skrik nettles themselves have few natural predators. They are reputed to taste so light and airy that eating one is like trying to eat a soap bubble, albeit a soap bubble with a half-dozen stinging beaks. Skrik nettles perceive the world by sensing air currents and shifting vibrations through their sensitive tentacles; during storms or strong winds, they secure themselves in the forks of large trees and wait out the harsh weather. Some fey hunt the skrik nettle shoals in little flying boats for sport, bringing them down with weighted nets or leaden harpoons. A few fey even try riding skrik nettles, \"docking\" them to make them harmless by clamping their beaks shut and then hanging a saddle from the tentacles, but the creatures are too weak to make good steeds. It is also the fashion in some regions for noble faerie-maidens to be accompanied by a small flock of \"docked\" skrik nettles, each one bearing a fan, mirror, or basket of fruit in its tentacles. Others capture skrik nettles and train them to speak-the skrik nettles are not intelligent, but they can be taught to imitate the speech of the First World, much like parrots can learn to imitate human tongues. A trained skrik nettle can even hold conversations with itself, with each of its half-dozen tentacles imitating a different voice.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Kingmaker.jpg","_id":"FAuRi9edHtnQeDXC"}

When the leucrotta calls out, the targets must make a DC 16 Will save or fall under the effects of a suggestion to approach the sound of the leucrotta's voice. This effect functions identically to a <i>mass suggestion</i> spell with a caster level equal to the leucrotta's Hit Dice. A creature that saves cannot be affected again by the same leucrotta's lure for 24 hours. The lure is a language-dependant effect, and if the leucrotta uses the victim's name during the lure, the victim suffers a -4 penalty on his saving throw. This is a sonic mindaffecting charm effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Powerful Bite (Ex)</strong> A leucrotta's bite attack always applies 1.5 times its Strength modifier to damage and threatens a critical hit on a roll of 19-20. Against objects, a leucrotta's bite treats the object as having a hardness of 5 less than the object's actual hardness rating.  </p><p><strong>Voice Mimicry (Ex)</strong> A leucrotta can perfectly imitate the voice of any creature it has heard talking. It makes a Bluff check when using voice mimicry-listeners may oppose this Bluff with Sense Motive checks to see through the mimicry, although if the listener isn't familiar with the voice of the person being mimicked, he suffers a -8 penalty on his Sense Motive check to oppose the leucrotta's Bluff. Leucrottas find it difficult to mimic the voices of creatures more than one size category smaller or larger than themselves and take a -8 penalty on their Bluff checks to mimic the voices of such smaller or larger creatures.</p></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Kingmaker.jpg","_id":"G7hcvTyDCMCgtlfa"}

She also has the advantage of being able to watch everything the PCs do in her home via the Fable. As a result, you should take the time to tailor Nyrissa's tactics to match the PCs' tactics as closely as possible. She begins most battles by casting <i>antilife shell</i> to prevent the PCs from approaching her if she can (although in the small confines of the Fable, she'll likely need to move up against a wall to make sure that the spell's emanation excludes the PCs when she casts it). She uses quickened spells to great effect, healing herself of damage or using them to cast spells like <i>haste</i>, <i>displacement</i>, or <i><i>greater</i> invisibility</i> to bolster her defenses. If one of the PCs wields <i>Briar</i>, she focuses all of her attention on that PC, doing everything she can to defend herself from that PC and either defeat him or separate him from <i><i>Briar</i>.</i> As an artifact, <i>Briar</i> is immune to <i>dispel magic</i> and damage, but that doesn't mean she can't use <i>telekinesis</i> to try to disarm it, <i>dismissal</i> on its wielder (only if the fight takes place on the First World), or (her favorite tactic) <i>maze</i> to keep that foe out of the battle (remember, though, that <i>Briar</i> grants SR 30 against her spells).</p><p><strong>Morale </strong>If Nyrissa is reduced to fewer than 100 hit points, she exits the Fable, then casts <i>dimension door</i> to reenter a different Fable portal long enough to use her magic to <i>heal</i> herself before she returns to area M7c to confront the PCs again. In the end, Nyrissa's madness and pride push her to the edge-she fights to the death.</p></div><hr /><div><p><strong>STATISTICS</strong></p></div><hr /><div><p><strong>Str </strong>14, <strong>Dex </strong>30, <strong>Con </strong>32, <strong>Int </strong> 22, <strong>Wis </strong>32, <strong>Cha </strong>36</p><p><strong>Base Atk </strong>+12; <strong>CMB </strong>+22; <strong>CMD </strong>48</p><p><strong>Feats </strong>Ability Focus (blinding beauty, stunning glance), Agile Maneuvers, Combat Casting, Craft Wondrous Item, Defensive Combat Training, Dodge, Eschew Materials, Extend Spell, Improved Initiative, Quicken Spell, Silent Spell, Toughness, Weapon Finesse</p><p><strong>Skills </strong>Acrobatics +38, Bluff +41, Climb +10, Diplomacy +41, Fly +43, Knowledge (nature) +34, Knowledge (planes) +31, Perception +39, Sense Motive +23, Stealth +38, Swim +30</p><p><strong>Languages </strong>Aklo, Common, Draconic, Elven, Giant, Gnome, Hallit, Skald, Sylvan</p><p><strong>SQ </strong>bloodline arcana, contingency, inherent bonuses, inspiration, unearthly grace, wild empathy +21, woodland stride</p><p><strong>Combat Gear </strong><i>rod of maximize metamagic</i>; <strong>Other Gear </strong><i>belt of physical perfection +6</i>, <i>bracers of armor +8</i>, <i>headband of mental superiority +6</i> (Acrobatics, Fly, Swim), <i>ioun stones</i> (orange prism, pale green prism), <i>ring of evasion</i>, <i>ring of freedom of movement</i>, <i>scarab of protection</i> (fully charged), <i>wings of flying</i>, fancy anklet worth 10,000 gp, 500 gp</p></div><hr /><div><p><strong>SPECIAL ABILITIES</strong></p></div><hr /><div><p><strong><i>Contingency</i></strong> If Nyrissa is brought below 0 hit points, a <i>cure critical wounds</i> spell <i>heal</i>s her of 4d8+16 points of damage. </p><p><strong>Inherent Bonuses</strong> Nyrissa has used a <i>manual of gainful exercise +4</i> and a <i>tome of understanding +5</i> to increase her Constitution and her Wisdom. </p><p><strong>Protection from Decapitation</strong> Nyrissa has used a <i>wish</i> from a ring to gain a special defense against beheading-the first time she is beheaded by any effect (including a vorpal weapon), the wound immediately <i>heal</i>s after it is dealt, effectively inflicts no damage, and does not decapitate her.

Otherwise, it functions as a <i>magic circle against evil</i> effect and a <i>lesser globe of invulnerability</i>, both with a radius of 20 feet (caster level equals the Stag's Hit Dice).

The range of communication extends outward 120 feet to all other bog striders within line of effect on or under the water.

Once it decides to increase its movement in this fashion, the effect lasts for up to 4 rounds, after which a bog strider becomes fatigued for as many rounds as it chose to move at a higher speed. </p><p><strong>Water Stride (Su)</strong> A bog strider can tread upon rivers, lakes, and flooded swamplands or marshes as if under the effects of the <i>water walk</i> spell. It also gains an increased movement rate by using the surface tension and its multiple legs to propel itself across the water.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Bog striders call themselves Ses'h in Aquan, but the first explorers to encounter them named the reclusive bug-men after their ability to stride on water like solid ground. Individual bog striders resemble upright beetles with four legs, two arms, and powerful mandibles. They depend on their waterborne speed to quickly chase down prey and flee from predators. Otherwise, they care little for civilizations other than their own, rarely venturing from the swampy rivers and lakes they call home. The long, spindly legs of bog striders give the impression of a greater size then their relatively fragile frames actually account for. Although their limbs are in most cases more than double, even triple, the length of other humanoids, their inflexible joints grant them little more mobility, range of motion, and capability to reach than others. Regardless of gender, nearly all bog striders stand 5 feet tall and weigh approximately 150 pounds.<strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p> Bog striders reproduce during specific seasonal and astrological cycles that occur only two to three times during their entire lifespan-detecting their moment of peak fertility through changes in the weather and tidal effects upon large bodies of water. Thereafter, pregnant females lay a clutch of four to 10 eggs, keeping them submerged and guarding against predators until they hatch 6 months later. The younglings then cling to their mother for the next 3 months as they learn the rudiments of survival and socialization within the tribe. Unfortunately, predators (intelligent or otherwise) often view bog strider eggs and younglings as easy prey. Hatcheries suffer attacks by crocodiles and giant frogs, while birds of prey, boggards, and human hunters pick off younglings who stray from their mothers on the open water. As a result of these reproductive challenges, bog striders struggle to keep pace with other swamp-dwelling cultures, suffering through periods of decline and nearextinction. These difficulties make them increasingly insular and territorial, meeting interlopers with spears more often than diplomacy. A bog strider's diet consists almost entirely of meat. They routinely hunt for fish, crustaceans, or snakes, and occasionally hunt for birds, giant wasps, or dragonflies. They particularly excel at spearfishing and snaring airborne prey with thrown nets. The wide stance of a bog strider's four legs displaces its weight over any body of water by maintaining the surface tension with a cushion of air trapped beneath several small ridges on each foot. While not dissimilar to the motion of minute water-striding insects, for bog striders the motion is aided by some manner of innate magic or other supernatural relationship with the water. Regardless of the source of this ability, it allows them to literally walk on water, though they can also fully submerge and hide below the surface if they desire. Bog striders who survive into adulthood can live up to 60 years. Each youngling develops a varied pattern of mottled gray and brown coloration across its carapace, uniquely distinguishing it from others. These spots tend to fade as bog striders age, causing their elders to all look much alike. Habitat &amp; Societ y Bog striders can survive in all but the coldest of climes, living their entire lives on the rivers, lakes, and bogs where they make their homes. Their society focuses primarily on survival due to the depredations of natural predators and wars with lizardfolk and boggards. Each member of a bog strider tribe, both male and female, learns to defend the tribe at the earliest possible age. In addition, everyone must develop a skill that contributes to the community's prosperity, and by extension, the continued survival of their species. Females serve as the builders of bog strider society. They weave large mats of reeds, rushes, and netting that they coat in waterproof tree sap to trap pockets of air below the water's surface where they can safely build and hide their villages. When not looking after their young, the females continuously expand or replace flooded sections of these communities. Meanwhile, male bog striders act as hunters and gatherers, bringing back enough food to last through harsh winters and times of drought. They also scout the waterways for threats to their community, leaving those who pass through their territory unmolested but fighting off those who attempt to stay or exploit the same resources they depend upon. Frequently small bands also venture far from their native lands, seeking to find new, uninhabited waterways where their imperiled communities might be left in peace. Seer-queens rule over multiple bog strider communities to form secluded tribal unions, acting as religious leaders and reading the river currents or tides to divine the will of Gozreh. Many become clerics or druids worshiping the nature god in its feminine form, though they interpret Gozreh more as a great body of water than a likeness of themselves. Because seer-queens lose their personal markings like any other elder, they are difficult to distinguish from the rest of their community. They often use this advantage to hide among their own people, both to thwart those who would target them and to mingle more freely among their subjects. </p><p><strong>Bog Strider Seer-Queens</strong><br /> Leaders of multiple tribes of bog striders, seer-queens help organize and coordinate efforts to stave off the extinction of their species and interpret the will of nature. The following adjustments to a standard bog strider represent a seer-queen. Many also pursue a deeper faith in Gozreh, attaining class levels as a cleric or druid. </p><p><strong>+5 natural armor</strong>.

This repulsion is all the more severe when a thawn sees its own reflection. Should a thawn be confronted with its own reflection (such as being presented with a mirror) it must make a DC 15 Will save or be sickened for 1d4+1 rounds.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Grotesque nomads native to wretched plains and barren hills, thawns seem to bear the curse of both nature and the divine. Ogre-like in stature and dimwittedness, these monstrously ugly humanoids bear fold upon fold of sagging, excess flesh, draping them in wrinkled, poxriddled hides. This wretched appearance, in tandem with their great size and monstrous claws, leads most creatures to shun them. Indeed, even thawns find one another repulsive, creating a barely tolerable society of universal mistrust and loathing.</p><p>Thawns average 9 feet tall and their excess skin pushes their average weight to 700 pounds.<strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong><br /> Often called \"mud giants\" due to the foul, mottled skin that hangs loosely from their misshapen frames, thawns are universally malformed and dreadful, though each is quite distinctive in its singular monstrousness. Hair only grows in small tufts-thick, oily, and black. Their eyes easily pick up the flaws in their appearance, driving them to hide their figures as much as possible. Such revulsion of their form has led many scholars to hypothesize that thawns once possessed a different one, potentially relating them directly to ogres, hill giants, or other humanoids victimized by the hands of some more powerful and malicious race. Such possibilities remain nothing more than conjecture, however, as the brutes have no ability and even less interest in retaining details of their history. Even with this overpowering self-loathing, ancient instincts drive thawns together for safety and procreation, and no other race tolerates their ugliness and savagery.</p><p>Opportunistic feeders, thawns seek out fresh battlefields and the scraps of slain beasts, reluctantly sharing their pickings with other parasites and scavengers. Alone as they wander the lands, thawns take care of their own needs first and foremost, caring little for others of their kind. Disdaining anything like a fair fight, they excel at crafting clever decoys and simple traps. Though sizable creatures, thawns typically strive to draw as little attention to themselves as possible, preferring to craft convincing dummies from mud, stone, and animal carcasses while they wait in hiding.<strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong><br /> Most thawns collect in nomadic groups, wandering grim plains and moody hills more like ravaging gangs than tribes traveling out of necessity. While their dim intellects provide them the most basic tools to seek out what they need to survive, their lives prove pitiful and often violently short. Hateful of themselves and their own kind, thawns aspire to no great works. Their nomadism thus comes less from need as from indifference, as one ugly hillside or leaking cave proves little better or worse than any other.</p><p>It's their own inhabitance that causes most thawns to move on, as once they've despoiled an area, it's then time to find new lands. This cycle of pillaging and pressing on proves uncomfortable to most thawns, but most lack the foresight to live any other way. Groups of thawns prove highly changeable, with members joining and leaving with little hesitation. As no love is lost between members, the savages drift apart as the whim takes them. Typically such changes in group structure go ignored, unless those left behind believe their former kinsman possesses some valuable information or reason for departing.</p><p>Thawns don't believe in hoarding material possessions, disdaining most metals and valuables in part because shiny surfaces invariably betray their monstrous visages to them. They use whatever is nearest at hand to satisfy their basic needs, though some carry with them items of simple usefulness or trophies of brutal victories. They move away from defended and civilized areas out of simple survival instinct, but attack small groups of humanoids if driven to desperation. Occasionally some uninformed samaritan attempts to take pity on a thawn, believing it cast out merely for its appearance and simplicity. Such charity typically proves fatal, though, as in the case of these hulks, their outward ugliness matches a dull-witted sadism and raving, violent hatred of all living things.</p><p>Even ogres, with whom they hold many similarities, revile thawns as mindless killers and bogeymen, attacking and slaying them on sight.</p><p>If mud giants excel at any one thing, it's physical deception. Knowing most creatures' hatred of them and their widespread treatment as dangerous lepers, they have learned to hide themselves where no sane creature would lurk and deceive eyes that would seek them with loathing.</p><p>Thus, thawns willingly lair and hide amid filth-choked pools, muddy ravines, rotting bogs, and worse places. To aid them in their ambushes, they often create cunningly hidden pits, similar simple traps, and, most notoriously, decoys.</p><p>With their misshapen frames, it's not difficult to mistake a tall, awkward pile of mud and rocks covered in rags for a thawn, while the reverse also proves dangerously true. More than one wary traveler, sighting a thawn-like shape upon a low hillock or on a dusty trail, has circled widely to avoid the dangerous hunter only to blunder into the ambush of the true thawn lurking in wait.</p><p><strong>Treasure</strong><br /> Thawns rarely keep any possessions other than those which they can carry, these typically being crude or foul items even the most desperate wayfarers wouldn't consider clothing or food.</p><p>In filthy sacks or-even more revoltingly- slung in useful flesh folds, there is a 40% chance that any thawn possesses 1d4 unsettling items, typically scraps of skin, leather, and stolen cloth for the creation of new cloaks; trophies of skulls, bones, and hide bound into crude fetishes; and rotting animal meat of unwholesome cuts and uncertain origin. Such things are typically soiled beyond use and rarely valuable, but often suggest what victims the mud giant has recently preyed upon and where their foul wanderings have led them.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Kingmaker.jpg","_id":"SErrX97FVGc5AiqM"}

Swarming forth from their shadowy dens to hunt by night, these strange predators thirst for blood, scavenging from the victims of greater nocturnal hunters and stalking those foolish enough not to fear dangers in the dark. Drawn by the scent of spilled blood, clawbats fearlessly follow deadly beasts, and more than one traveler has narrowly escaped a predator's nearly lethal ambush only to find his luck change as a swarm of wings and eyes descend upon him. The span of an average clawbat's dual pairs of wings stretches 3 feet wide, lifting aloft rubbery bodies weighing 2 to 4 pounds. Tales of more monstrous clawbats, with wings that blot out the stars as they swoop away with children and small animals, also pass through the civilized lands of Iobaria. Such overgrown clawbats might be constructed by making use of the giant creature simple template.<strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p> Clawbats are scavengers and opportunistic hunters. They rarely attack creatures larger than rodents or birds unless the creatures-or those traveling with them-have been weakened by a stronger attacker. Even the presence of such a hunter is not enough to deter an ever-hungry clawbat, which is drawn to attack bloodied creatures in the thick of battle. Clawbats are poor fighters; they prefer to fly past victims, strike quickly to draw blood, and then make pass after pass, aggravating their victims' existing wounds with their ribbon-like tongues. This tactic rarely wins the scavengers more than a drop or two of nourishment per attack, driving them to harass a victim until it drops. When the wounds of clawbats' prey prove too insignificant to fell it, clawbats attack more directly, circling to peel away strip after strip of flesh in wet grabs of their tentacular maws. After their prey has fallen to the pain of a dozen such wounds, clawbats land and vigorously lap up their meal until their bellies are bloated with gore. Aiding clawbats in their hunts is their acrid saliva, a stinging milky-white fluid that possesses an anticoagulant quality, causing their bites to leave messy wounds that bleed until treated. This effect allows clawbats to surprise attack most Small creatures and wait safely out of reach until the prey collapses. Healthy larger prey can typically withstand the assault of a lone clawbat, but a whole clutch of the creatures might easily throw even a sturdy beast into panicked, bleeding terror. The freedom with which clawbat wounds bleed also serves to attract other clawbats in the vicinity, and a few scratches might potentially bring an entire clutch down upon even a slightly wounded creature. Clawbat eyes are exceedingly abnormal, being nearly flat, yet still functional. As the creatures' eyes are set upon their wings, the constant flapping gives the clawbats a constantly shifting view of the area around them, but particularly the land below-an experience which would seem terribly jarring to any creature not used to the experience. The eyes are one-sided, occupying only the inner part of their thick, fleshy wings, and are lidless, being constantly watered by ducts surrounding each eye. The profuse watering of these organs causes clawbats to fling a fine spray as they move, which often serves as a victim's first warning of impending danger. Other flying creatures, such as hawks, eagles, and owls, make up the clawbats' natural predators. The sounds of these raptors can dissuade clawbats from attacking, even in the midst of a feeding frenzy, and will send them winging straight for their roost to avoid attack. Giant centipedes occasionally invade clawbat lairs, crawling up the wall or waiting for their prey at the exit. Clawbats have little natural defense against creatures with thick exoskeletons and avoid them when it is possible to attack an easier source of food. Clawbats can live up to 20 years, though most die earlier due to predation, accidents, or infighting.<strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p> Clawbats are found far from heavily civilized lands, though whether this is due to civilized efforts to stamp them out or because they prefer distant, half-wild places is open to debate. They live in clutches of up to 15 members, favoring dark places that offer easy aerial access to the outside world. Each of these places must have a roost that allows the creatures to drop the 15 feet necessary to begin flying; if a stationary clawbat attempts to start flying without sufficient drop, it glides to the ground and must mount to a higher point before it can launch again. This makes them skittish in claustrophobic spaces, for they do not like to be at a disadvantage, and this in turn leads them to infest places such as ruined structures, large, open caves, and fissures. New clutches of clawbats contain 4 to 6 young members, which depart a clutch once it has grown to exceed 15 members. The young fly 10 to 15 miles away, searching for a suitable structure or crag to shield them during the day. Once a group of clawbats leaves its original home, the members feel no loyalty to their former family and compete fiercely for resources. On numerous occasions, mages, druids, and barbarians shamans have attempted to capture and train clawbats. While the creatures' awkwardness once they are brought to ground makes them relatively easy to capture-though frustratingly difficult to restrain given their flexibility and many squirming limbs- no documented attempt to train the beasts has ever succeeded. Even efforts paired with steady diets of blood typically end in the clawbat attacking its keeper just as often as availing themselves of the easier food source.

They collect and train with their infernally forged glaives among the vaults of Hell's third layer, Erebus, but inevitably return to the first layer, Avernus, to serve at the side of the dread lord Barbatos.</p><p>Barbazus are fond of making charge attacks with their glaives, and try to maintain a 10-foot gap between themselves and their foes so they can use their signature polearms to great effect. Against a foe that has greater reach (or one able to otherwise avoid the devil's favored tactic), they drop their glaives and resort to their claws and hideous beards.</p><p>At attention, bearded devils stand over 6 feet tall (though their squatting battle stances often make them appear shorter) and weigh upward of 200 pounds.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Kingmaker.jpg","_id":"SiGuP2gxVX7RqvVj"}

Related to deer, elk prove important parts of many ecologies, being able to fend off or flee many threats while feeding greater predators. Their size, strength, and antlers-reaching up to 10 feet wide on some males- allow them to contend with most of their environment's dangers, though herds generally favor flight to combat.</p><p>Elk also prove exceptionably adaptable and remarkable survivors, capable of living through severe changes in weather and in a variety of environments without concern.</p><p>Many humanoid cultures rely on elk herds, using them as valued food sources, work animals, and companions.</p><p>Most breeds of elk stand between 3 and 5 feet tall and weigh between 350 and 550 pounds, with females being far slighter than males. Heartier stock, such as the river elk seen throughout the River Kingdoms, Brevoy, and much of northern Avistan and Iobaria, grow to approximately 6 feet tall and weigh between 700 and 1,100 pounds. In some secluded wilds, primeval megaloceros-massive ancestors of the elk-still flourish, standing up to 9 feet tall, with bulks of 1,500 pounds and antlers growing over 12 feet wide.</p><p>In all species, only male elk grow antlers. Female elk have the same statistics as males, but lack the gore or powerful charge attacks.<strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong><br /> Elk live relatively long lives for herd animals, with some bulls living for over 15 years. Physiologically, they're similar to deer and other grazing animals with their patterns of travel and interaction with other creatures. Because of their size, though, they can damage an ecosystem, eating great amounts of food and sometimes competing with other herbivores for resources.</p><p>Bull elk keep their antlers for about 7 to 8 months of the year, maintaining them as a primary form of defense. The antlers of common elk stand 4 feet tall and spread about 6 feet wide. Both bulls and cows are quite strong, their kicks proving deadly deterrents against many would-be attackers.</p><p>Most breeds of elk stay in herds with upwards of 50 members. Herd members actively protect each other, doing what they can to defend those incapable of fleeing, yet also recognizing hopeless causes. Very few predators can stand up to a group of defensive elk, though wolves, bears, boars, and hunting cats often attack the young, sick, or unwary who venture away from the herd. While most natural predators steer clear of elk herds, many humanoid or monstrous hunters manage to pick off elk by relying on ranged weapons or great physical prowess.<strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong><br /> During most of the year, elk maintain large groups of their own genders. Cows and the young tend to stick near dens, so bulls are more likely to be found wandering their wide territories. During mating season, a dominant bull maintains a harem of as many as 20 cows. Any threat to that establishment is met with violent force, with battles between rivals often resulting in fierce clashing of antlers and contests of strength-though such rarely prove deadly. During mating season, cows don't always produce offspring, though when they do, typically only one or two elk are born.</p><p>After mating season, cows care for calves for only a short time. Most are only nursed for a couple of months before they join with the rest of the herd. Elk are hibernating creatures, being almost unheard of during the winter season. During the remainder of the year, they roam and graze widely. When they make their tell-tale noise (called bugling,) it booms and echoes for miles, and females often consider the loudest males the most suitable as mates.</p><p>Elk migrate throughout the year, typically to avoid the snow. They move from low to high ground, where tree bark is an abundant food source. During the summer months, they graze on the grasses they can find. During dry seasons, elk often make great trips to find abundant food sources, which can sometimes force out lesser creatures from a habitat.</p><p>Elk are also know to vary widely from region to region.</p><p>Common in Brevoy, the River Kingdoms, and secluded spots of Numeria, river elks prove larger and heartier than most of their brethren. Named for their tendencies to travel along rivers and the comfort with which they enter water, these elk exhibit a daring unknown to most other breeds, the bulls willingly fighting to defend their herds from any perceived threats.</p><p><strong>Megaloceros</strong><br /> Similar in form to the elk but far superior in size is the megaloceros. The average male is a towering, dangerous creature with antlers that can alone weigh nearly 100 pounds. Unlike elk, megaloceros antlers are decidedly enormous and sometimes wider than their bodies are long.</p><p>This leads to common misconceptions and exaggerations about the creature's monstrous size.

Anytime a calathgar is subjected to cold damage, it regains 1 hit point (regardless of the amount of cold damage dealt). When in areas of severe cold (such as arctic regions or near brown mold), a calathgar gains fast healing 1. </p><p><strong>Mold Mulch (Ex)</strong> Upon being reduced to 0 hit points, a calathgar withers and swiftly decays, transforming into a 5-foot patch of brown mold. If a calathgar is killed by fire, the mold immediately grows into a 10-foot patch. If it is killed in a space already occupied by brown mold, that mold patch doubles in size just as though fire had been brought near. The area within 30 feet of brown mold is cold enough to activate a calathgar's cold healing and the persistent effect of its seed spray. Brown mold deals 3d6 points of nonlethal cold damage to all creatures within 5 feet of it. See page 416 of the <i>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</i> for additional details. </p><p><strong>Seed Spray (Ex)</strong> Once every 1d4 rounds, up to 3 times per day, a calathgar can expel a blast of thorny, frozen seeds in a 15-foot cone. All creatures in this area take 4d6 points of cold damage (Reflex DC 15 for half ). In frigid climes-areas where the temperature is 40 degrees or colder-these seeds cling to those they strike, dealing an additional 1d6 points of cold damage on the following round. The save DC is Constitution-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Known to grow in the depths of the densest frozen forests, realms where icicles rarely melt from the snow-cloaked trees, calathgars, or \"hail lilies,\" grow to a size and possess an alien beauty that make their cuttings greatly desired in civilized lands. Yet, what few beside the wariest hunters and most knowledgeable denizens of the forests realize is that hail lilies are more than mere flowers-their fully grown varieties possess not only a deadly way of spreading their frozen seeds but also an even more dangerous trait: thought. Known among their own kind as calathgars, these ice-tinged plants move slowly and possess little in the way of society, yet they perceive their surroundings, know when their frigid gardens are threatened, feel pain, and-most tenaciously- seek a chilling revenge when their young are despoiled. The blooms of a fully grown calathgar measures 3 feet in diameter, though some have reported flowers up to 5, 8, and even 10 feet wide. Able to crawl on three tendrillike roots, one of these plants might stand as high as 4 feet off the ground, and when heavy with seeds might weigh as much as 50 pounds.<strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p> Calathgars are immediately identifiable, even from a distance, by their sky-blue petals, a color repeated by few other forms of plant life in such size or brilliance. Yet typically, these blooms only unfurl during the brightest hours of the day or when the plants feel threatened. At all other times, calathgars keep their flowers closed, defending the sensitive structures within and presenting large, blue-gray sepals to the outside world. Calathgar young look little different from tall blue flowers-hence many horticulturists identify them merely as hail lilies. It takes nearly a year for a juvenile calathgar to display any kind of concerted movement, aside from the opening and closing of their petals and a few markedly un-plant-like twitches. Their sense of scent and ability to communicate function as soon as their buds first grow-typically within 2 weeks of sprouting from the cold earth. Two rings of sensory organs help calathgars remain aware of their surroundings: a cluster of lobes at the base of the flower and another situated around the stamen within. Both are capable of not just deciphering light in an approximation of visual sight, but also receiving information via a highly developed kind of scent. This sense of smell is much more developed in the plants than their ability to see-though at close ranges their sight can prove just as accurate as most humanoids. To this end, most communication between the plants is scent-based, utterly silent, and often imperceptible to non-plant creatures. At times when the plants feel threatened, however, they exude a smell like vinegar or, if angry, a coppery odor. For all their developments as a species, calathgars possess a strange connection, even symbiosis, with a far less complex type of growth: brown mold. Notorious for its ability to drain the warmth from an area and freeze the unwary, brown mold not only benefits calathgars-allowing them to grow comfortably in areas they might otherwise find inhospitably warm-but it also pervades the roots and internal structures of the plants. Some suggest that calathgars might be some advanced form of brown mold, yet the idea is typically dismissed, as such mutually beneficial relationships are well documented in the world of mundane flora. As a calathgar grows to maturity, brown mold thrives within its flower and internal structures, aiding in keeping the growth cool and providing it with frigid defensive abilities and a way to spread its seeds-freezing and clinging to creatures that come near before dropping off later. The flowers provide the mold ample places to grow, and defense from creatures that might threaten it. The adult plants also prove so riddled with nutrients upon which the fungus flourishes that should a calathgar violently die amid brown mold, the fungal patch instantly explodes with growth-typically to the detriment of whatever ended the calathgar's life.<strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p> Calathgars have little in the way of society, other than grouping together for mutual defense. Despite their intellects, the plants' psyches prove distinctive and alien in comparison to those of animals and sentient creatures. They have little interest in emotions, culture, or ambition, yet they possess nearly flawless memories and an understanding of experiences which they can share with other calathgars by scent as easily as (and far more effectively than) humanoids can pass on information by speech. Yet where calathgars do seem most like humanoids is in their capacity to care for their young and seek reprisal should any harm befall them. Should an immature calathgar be trampled, plucked, or otherwise ruined, adults do all they can to pursue and deal vengeance upon those who murdered their young, planting a new generation in the killer's frozen flesh. While calathgars can be reasoned with and most prove generally accepting of honest apologies from those capable of communicating with them, like most enraged parents, an incensed calathgar is rarely in a mood to speak.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Kingmaker.jpg","_id":"TpCFy4TMcwdGnn9k"}

The new drekavac is not in any way controlled by its maker, and is immediately capable of exercising its full powers, including creating spawn of its own. It does not possess any of the abilities it had in life.  </p><p><strong>Disease (Su)</strong> Drekavacs are spirits of disease and contagion.  While most drekavacs carry bubonic plague, drekavacs who died from other afflictions may carry those diseases instead.  Any illness caused by a drekavac must be potentially fatal.  Other diseases commonly carried include demon fever, filth fever, and slimy doom. If a drekavac is reduced to 0 hit points (from weapons or other sources, including channeled energy), all of the diseases it caused are cured, although the victims must recover from any effects normally, and slain victims are not restored.  Bubonic plague: Touch-injury; save Fort DC 15; onset 1 day; frequency 1/day; effect 1d4 Con damage, 1 Cha damage, victim is fatigued; cure 2 consecutive saves.  </p><p><strong>Diseased Shadow (Su)</strong> Any creature touched by a drekavac's shadow is also affected by the creature's disease ability. If there is a question about which way the drekavac's shadow falls, roll 1d8 to determine a random square around the creature. A character with a light source cannot be touched by the drekavac's shadow, but the light causes the shadow to fall directly opposite the character (unless there is another light source there as well). A drekavac can deliberately touch a creature with its shadow as a standard action by making a successful touch attack.  A target missed by the drekavac's chilling grasp attack must make a DC 15 Reflex save to avoid being touched by the creature's shadow as well. This save DC is Charisma-based.</p><p><strong>  Sunlight Aversion (Ex)</strong> Drekavacs hate natural sunlight and immediately flee from it. A drekavac caught in natural sunlight is staggered.  </p><p><strong>Unnatural Aura (Su)</strong> Animals, wild or domesticated, can sense the unnatural presence of a drekavac at a distance of 30 feet. They do not willingly approach nearer than that and panic if forced to do so unless a master succeeds at a DC 25 Handle Animal, Ride, or wild empathy check. Panicked animals remain so as long as they are within 30 feet of the drekavac.</p><p><strong>  Vulnerability to Magic (Ex)</strong> A remove curse or remove disease spell cast directly upon a drekavac (DC equal to the drekavac's disease ability) immediately destroys the creature, allowing the afflicted soul to move on. Destroying a drekavac with remove curse or remove disease does not cure any of the creature's diseases.</p><p><strong>  Vulnerability to Salt (Ex)</strong> Drekavacs are vulnerable to salt that has been consecrated in the same fashion as holy water, and cannot cross an unbroken line of blessed salt. A handful of blessed salt thrown at a drekavac inflicts the same damage as a flask of holy water (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 160).</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Drekavacs are the undead remains of children who perished from disease, particularly in plague-ridden areas where many such deaths occurred in a short period of time. Able to become as insubstantial as the mist rising from a graveyard on a cold, dark night, drekavacs are carriers of disease, seeking to infect the living with the afflictions that slew them. According to some stories, drekavacs only result from young plague victims who remain unburied or died bereft of the proper funeral rites; performing those rites may allow their spirits to rest and no longer haunt the world of the living.<strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong><br /> Drekavacs typically haunt desolate places, from windswept plains and mountains to dark forests and abandoned homes or villages. They may move among inhabited areas in gaseous form, but are typically warded off by bright lights and the sounds and sights of life. They are always encountered indoors or at night, preferring dark, cloudy or foggy nights, ideally during the waning moon. Drekavacs are usually encountered during the gloomy, cold winter months rather than in the spring or summer.</p><p>Rural clerics and adepts must sometimes deal with one or more drekavacs seeking to spread disease in their communities. Their favored targets are children, some of whom can also become drekavacs 3 days after death unless their bodies are burned and the ashes scattered.</p><p>The work of drekavacs in a community can sometimes lead to hysterical accusations by grief-stricken parents and families, stirring up resentment and violence toward outsiders or anyone suspected of involvement with unnatural forces.</p><p>It is customary in some rural areas to surround a child's crib with a ring of blessed salt to keep evil influences at bay, including drekavacs, who cannot cross an unbroken line of salt. However, drekavacs can convince others to break the line of salt for them.<strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong><br /> Drekavacs are lonesome, bitter, and pitiful creatures, often crying when they appear, mourning their lost lives. Some folk mistake them for living children, lost or starving, although the creatures are not very effective liars. Still, a dim night and a half-seen form huddled and sobbing pitifully are often enough to trick someone into approaching close enough to become victim of the drekavac's chilling grasp.</p><p>Once they have inflicted their plagues upon victims, drekavacs quickly lose interest and move on, although they may follow a victim, begging for aid and attention, behaving as if they were still living victims of disease rather than its agents. They rarely kill victims outright, preferring instead to inflict long and lingering deaths through disease. Drekavacs threatened with salt, magic, or silver weapons become vicious, attacking opponents like snarling dogs until they are dead or the creatures are driven off.</p><p>Drekavacs sometimes band together in small packs, particularly in places where epidemics or plagues have swept through a population, either recently or long ago, but they have no real organization beyond seeking out new victims to infect. Drekavacs are intelligent and aware, able to converse in Common, or whatever languages they knew in life. This means some drekavacs are only able to communicate in largely dead or forgotten languages. They are childlike in their understanding and largely incapable of being reasoned with, but deft use of Bluff or Diplomacy and a playful or parental tone may keep a drekavac at bay, at least temporarily.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Kingmaker.jpg","_id":"UVzw87wCQKQbkPKC"}

If the monster is reduced to fewer than 200 hit points, it takes to the air and circles, firing one eye ray per round with Vital Strike while it heals back up to at least 300 hit points before landing and entering melee again. If denied this level of mobility, the monster simply focuses its full attacks on single targets, hoping to take the PCs down one at a time. At your discretion, if the monster defeats the wielder of <i>Briar</i>, it could scoop up the weapon and take to the air.

Alternatively, the lesser jabberwock can focus its burble attack to create a 60-foot-line of sonic energy that inflicts 20d6 points of sonic damage (DC 28 Reflex save for half).

If it is hit by a critical threat from a <i><i>vorpal</i> weapon</i>, whether or not the critical hit is confirmed, the jabberwock is staggered for the following round.  </p><p><strong>Whiffling (Ex)</strong> A lesser jabberwock's wings and violent motions create a significant amount of wind whenever it makes a full attack action. These winds surround the monster to a radius of 30 feet, and are treated as severe winds-ranged attacks suffer a -4 penalty to hit a lesser jabberwock when it is whiffling, and Medium creatures must make a DC 10 Strength check to approach the creature. Small or smaller creatures in this area that fail a DC 15 Strength check are blown away. See page 439 of the <i>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</i> for further details on the effects of severe winds.</p></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Kingmaker.jpg","_id":"Uq6TL2TqsMAtHGmm"}

Beings as much composed of sculpted arcane eddies as of flesh and blood, these capricious felines flourish along the intangible ley lines of their home realm, drinking in its weird powers as a plant thrives on light. Yet even more potent than their thirst for magic and the euphoria they draw from being in proximity to the reshaping of reality is dweomercats' racial curiosity, which leads them endlessly across the First World-and often beyond. The average adult dweomercat is about 4 feet tall and 7 feet long, weighing over 250 pounds, while their cubs are approximately 1 foot tall and weigh no more than 15 pounds.<strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p> A newly born dweomercat cub is connected to its homeland by only a thin tether of fey magic, and can only tap into its true potential during the instant a spell is cast upon it. The burst of magical energy brought forth by a freshly cast spell momentarily intensifies the bond between the First World and the dweomercat. This link manifests itself clumsily as a sort of sudden teleportation that heaves the fey cat through space and time toward the source of the spell, fueled by the magnetic reaction between the dweomercat and the magic's origin. A dweomercat grows not by the passage of time, but through direct exposure to fey magic. Thus, a dweomercat cub on the Material Plane is stunted developmentally. Though it ages and gains experience and practical wisdom anywhere, only by spending several lifetimes on the First World can the cub reach adulthood. Once it has reached this stage, however, a fully grown dweomercat may freely travel between its native land and the Material Plane without adverse effects.<strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p> In the First World, dweomercats travel in packs while hunting. Beyond this predatory advantage, however, they have little use for organized society, as the evershifting nature of their homeland impedes it anyway. Dweomercats that are born on or come to be stranded on the Material Plane are often forced to live on their own. Cut off from the direct magical eddies of the First World, dweomercat cubs prove unable to grow into adults. While they might become slightly stronger and more learned, they never reach the size and prowess of those constantly subjected to the magic of their homeland. Were a dweomercat cub to return to the First World, it would eventually grow into a normal dweomercat, but only over the course of numerous humanoid lifespans. Those dweomercats marooned on the Material Plane seek out areas of great age, changeability, and magical potency- lands most like the First World. Sometimes this means not a specific place, but rather a period spent journeying with a mortal spellcaster. While an adult dweomercat would scoff at the idea of following a humanoid's orders, adolescents see the benefit of journeying alongside an intelligent creature native to the alien world. Should a dweomercat cub find a magic-user reckless or whimsical enough to keep its attention, it might join the caster as a familiar, gaining a measure of constant magical exposure from the intangible connection inherent in such a mystical relationship.<br /><strong>Dweomercat Cubs as Familiars </strong><br />Attracted to flashy displays of magic and the strange powers inherent in a bond between a magic-user and her familiar, a dweomercat cub that's wandered from the First World might find its taste for magic and adventure satisfied in the service of a particularly whimsical or ostentatious arcane spellcaster. A spellcaster with the Improved Familiar feat can acquire a chaotic neutral dweomercat cub at 7th level or higher. Should the spellcaster settle into a life of research and predictability for a span of months, the dweomercat cub familiar might take to wandering off and, eventually, might not return-deliberately severing the master-familiar bond and freeing the spellcaster to summon a new familiar.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Kingmaker.jpg","_id":"VEFXxYYW17wGzWFC"}

Of course, in her rage, Engelidis is unwilling to retain her loyalty to the PCs after Irovetti is dead; she tries to escape at once, and if the PCs oppose her flight, she attacks them as well.

A rorkoun can move into even smaller spaces by contracting, allowing it to treat its size as two size categories smaller.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Little-known denizens of the Darklands, rorkouns prey upon the unwary from lairs amid the deepest pools and waterways. Known as \"wretch worms\" and \"eyes of Orv,\" these disgusting abominations writhe through flooded pits and crevices, feeding upon nearly all they encounter and occasionally breaking forth from the depths into the world of light to glut themselves upon the plump, tender creatures found there. Rorkouns measure over 25 feet in length, and beneath the strange secretions that provide them with a false, apparent bulk, the creatures possess a ribbon-thin body only a foot wide. A typical rorkoun weighs a mere 200 pounds.<strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p> Little is known of the anatomy and life processes of rorkouns because of both their rarity and their fundamental dependency on water. As soon as a rorkoun leaves the water-which none ever do willingly, even to pursue the most tempting prey-it begins dehydrating at a deadly rate. Most that are ripped from their native pools wither to long strips of jerky-like flesh in a few short minutes. Thus, much of what is known of the beasts comes from direct observation, a methodology that proves dangerous for most researchers. Rorkouns possess lengthy bodies similar to tapeworms, with simple, decentralized bodily systems. Their flat, oblong heads branch into four split mouthparts set on throat-like stalks. At the top of the head, a single, bulging eye scans the creature's surroundings with uncanny sensitivity. Their heads are the thickest parts of their bodies, which taper gradually to a powerful tail. The strangest quality of these creatures is that their body exudes a rubbery, gluelike substance that swiftly hardens into a flexible, puttylike mass. Rorkouns use these secretions to better protect their bodies, seal off their chosen lairs (to prevent water from seeping out), and capture their prey. Several explorers who have encountered rorkouns have spread unnerving stories regarding the beasts, suggesting that rorkouns are not individual creatures but rather the impossibly long appendages of some unknown aberrant body. Their hesitance to leave the water is thus claimed to be because they are incapable of separating themselves from their greater body; the frantic thrashing of rorkoun that are forcibly removed from the water as they struggle to return is compared to the final desperate twitches of an amputated limb. What terrible body might support limbs as vile as rorkouns few dare to conjecture, but whatever hidden beings (or more terrible still, single being) manipulate these horrors from the darkness must be unlike anything known to the denizens of Golarion's surface-and must hunger endlessly.<strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p> Solitary creatures, rorkoun rarely share hunting grounds. Most, upon encountering another of their kind, attempt to leave the vicinity, avoiding any sort of confrontation and often ridding the area of both creatures. This aversion proves baffling, especially considering the extreme rarity of the beasts, though some suggest that the abominations might prove more receptive toward others of their kind when far below the surface. Those scholars who study rorkouns claim the strange beasts understand both the Common language and that of goblins, though most believe the creatures also have a silent language used among their own kind-despite the creatures' tendency to avoid contact with one another. They frequently live near goblin and mite communities. While these species share an ecological niche as scavengers and occasional hunters, the connection is a bit more complex. Rorkouns never hunt goblins or mites as they find the taste of their flesh repulsive. The creatures do, however, find the savory flavor of greater humanoids succulent; they appreciate the zeal with which those races seek to exterminate goblinkind, as it brings prey close to their lairs for them to feast on. Cowardly and secretive, rorkouns lurk in murky pools or bogs near such creatures' camps, hoping to provoke a fight. Once the battle begins, rorkouns strike, picking off the weakest creatures in the fray before slinking off to digest the meal in the privacy of their dens or some other location where their prey's allies might find it difficult to follow. A rorkoun's benefactors rarely understand the reason for this strange kind of cooperation. While mites tend to fear and flee the aberrations-just as they do most creatures- goblins often concoct more elaborate reasons for why these alien horrors might aid them. Typically, a particularly imaginative goblin convinces his tribe that the rorkoun is in fact a god and that they are its chosen people. All too often this inspires the community to new heights of crazed zealotry and the invention of bizarre forms of sacrifice and adoration. Occasionally rorkouns find their way into the dilapidated or abandoned sewer systems of ruined or declining cities where the shattered remains of such networks have collapsed and formed connections to the Darklands. There rorkouns crawl and swim their way through the slick tunnels and drainpipes, feeding on refuse, vermin, and the occasional sewer dweller or rat catcher. Such unusual beasts rarely prove significant threats, emerging to menace the surface only through what abandoned tunnels and drainage ditches they might happen upon.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Kingmaker.jpg","_id":"jvqfzM0BEAcJOJvb"}

He figures that if he can egg their jousting contestant into attacking him, he can kill that PC in self-defense without getting in too much trouble. He does not attempt to unseat a PC contestant, but instead makes actual attacks against his opponent with his lance on each pass. Note that each time a character takes damage while riding, she must make a DC 5 Ride check to remain in the saddle-it's certainly possible this tactic could unseat a particularly inept rider. To observers, of course, Villamor's tactics are easily mistaken for overly aggressive attempts to unseat a rider-the crowd certainly loves the violence. If he's properly unseated by a PC, Villamor swallows his pride for now and nurtures the thought of revenge-he's one of Irovetti's closest allies, after all, and knows that the king plans to go to war.</p><p><strong>Morale </strong>Villamor does not fight to the death at this time; if the PCs respond to his goading by attacking, he'll \"defend\" himself (and attempt to kill the attacking PC), but if all the PCs start to gang up on him, or if he's reduced to fewer than 150 hit points, he breaks off his attack and Irovetti steps in to try to calm things down. If the PCs continue to attack, Irovetti uses <i>dimension door</i> to escape back to the Royal Pavilion with Villamor and announces that the Rushlight Festival is cancelled due to unwarranted aggression on a visitor's behalf. He gives the PCs an hour to leave Pitax before he attempts to have them arrested as criminals; in any event, this development gives him a handy, if flimsy, excuse to go to war with the PCs. Certainly the PCs aren't thought of kindly by the other competitors and attendants at the festival, for they see the PCs as the ones responsible for the tournament's cancellation in this case. See Part Two for more information on how the war develops.</p></div><hr /><div><p><strong>STATISTICS</strong></p></div><hr /><div><p><strong>Str </strong>24, <strong>Dex </strong>13, <strong>Con </strong>22, <strong>Int </strong> 8, <strong>Wis </strong>12, <strong>Cha </strong>10</p><p><strong>Base Atk </strong>+15; <strong>CMB </strong>+22; <strong>CMD </strong>34</p><p><strong>Feats </strong>Critical Focus, Dodge, Improved Critical (greataxe), Iron Will, Power Attack, Staggering Critical, Toughness, Vital Strike, Weapon Focus (greataxe)</p><p><strong>Skills </strong>Intimidate +18, Knowledge (nature) +13, Linguistics +0, Perception +14, Ride +15, Survival +14</p><p><strong>Languages </strong>Common, Halit</p><p><strong>SQ </strong>fast movement</p><p><strong>Combat Gear </strong><i>potions of barkskin +5</i> (3); <strong>Other Gear </strong><i>+5 hide armor</i>, <i>+1 vicious greataxe</i>, <i>ring of protection +2</i></p></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Kingmaker.jpg","_id":"l4O8e3N4XDdXK966"}

This allows it to see in all directions at once. It cannot be flanked. </p><p><strong>Caster Link (Ex)</strong> When a soul eater is summoned to the Material Plane, it creates a mental link between itself and the caster who summoned it. If the soul eater's assigned target dies before the soul eater can devour its soul, the soul eater returns at full speed to the caster and attacks him. Likewise, if the soul eater is defeated in battle (but not slain) by its target, the creature returns to the caster and attacks him. So long as both the caster and the soul eater are on the same plane of existence, the soul eater can successfully locate the caster using its find target ability. If the caster leaves the plane, the link is temporarily broken. Once the caster returns or the soul eater enters the plane the caster is now on, the link is immediately restored. </p><p><strong>Find Target (Su)</strong> When ordered to find a creature, a soul eater does so unerringly, as though guided by a <i>locate creature</i> spell that has no maximum range and is not blocked by running water. The being giving the order must have seen the creature to be found and must speak the target's name (this limits Vordakai's choices to PCs whose name he knows learned through observation via his familiar). </p><p><strong>Soul Drain (Su)</strong> When a soul eater reduces a foe to 0 Wisdom, it can devour that creature's soul as a standard action that provokes an attack of opportunity. The victim can resist having his soul drained by making a DC 17 Fortitude save. If he does, he is slain but can be restored to life normally. If the victim fails, he is immediately slain and his soul is consumed by the soul drinker. A victim slain in this manner cannot be returned to life through <i>clone</i>, <i>raise dead</i>, <i>reincarnation</i>, <i>resurrection</i>, <i>true <i>resurrection</i></i>, or even a <i>miracle</i> or <i>wish.</i> The victim's soul remains within the essence of the soul eater forever-unless the soul eater is slain while the victim's body is within 30 feet and the victim has been dead for no more than 1 minute. In that case, the victim's soul returns to the body and restores it to life (although at -1 hit point). This is a death effect. The save DC is Constitution-based. </p><p><strong>Wisdom Damage (Su)</strong> A creature hit by a soul eater's claw must succeed on a DC 17 Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of Wisdom damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.</p></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Kingmaker.jpg","_id":"pZODf8HJ93meKDJC"}

They typically hunt alone, only occasionally forming small packs.</p><p>Thylacines hunt at night, and rest during the day in nests hidden away from the world in hollowed trees or bushes. Farmers fear the creatures, blaming all manner of problems on them. However, thylacines are quite shy and antisocial, and usually avoid human settlements. Because of their odd, almost hybrid appearance, thylacines have a far harsher reputation than they probably should, playing a sort of bogeyman role in farming communities.<strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong><br /> At a distance, thylacines are sometimes mistaken for dogs or jackals, but can be easily identified by the defining stripes on their gold-hued backs. Thylacines usually have between 13 and 21 dark stripes. Their muscular jaws, filled with teeth, can gape open to an impressive 120 degrees.</p><p>While thylacines may appear rather quick, they are far from proficient runners. Due to their oddly shaped legs, their run is awkward and slow. However, the animals can stand on their haunches for short periods, helping them to fend off other predators and kill larger prey. Thylacines are also capable jumpers, not dissimilar to kangaroos, and often surprise opponents with this ability.</p><p>By most standards, a thylacine's senses aren't impressive. They can see and hear well enough to hunt prey, but their olfactory senses, while competent, do not approach canine levels. Thylacines hunt in a manner similar to wolves, focusing on wearing down prey by chasing and harrying instead of direct attacks. Their stomachs are able to greatly distend, enabling thylacines to eat vast amounts of food in a single sitting, devouring larger animals to compensate for long periods of drought or poor hunting.</p><p>Thylacines are quite cowardly, avoiding confrontation whenever possible. If cornered, a thylacine tries to frighten off attackers with growls, hisses, and threat-yawns, in which it displays its teeth and the full extent of its wide jaws. If these threat displays are ineffective, however, a thylacine does not hesitate to attack. Their powerful jaws may not snap bones, but they can still make quick work of an unprepared traveler. In addition, thylacines are not picky eaters. If driven to starvation, they aren't afraid to hunt humans, in which case their nocturnal hunting cycles tend to lead them to attack sleeping travelers or outlying farms.</p><p>Thylacines are fiercely independent. While wolves and other canines can be tamed and domesticated, thylacines are wild without exception. If captured, they become territorial and mark everything they can in their territories with strong-smelling odors from their scent glands.</p><p>Many a farmer has made the sad mistake of attempting to domesticate a thylacine, only to find his farm smelling atrocious and his livestock killed in the night.</p><p>An adult thylacine stands 2 feet tall at the shoulder, is 4 feet long (not counting an additional 2 feet of tail), and weighs roughly 50 pounds. The larger and more aggressive brush thylacine breed can reach almost 8 feet long from nose to tail-tip, though still only weighing 100 pounds.<strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong><br /> Thylacines breed year-round, but like most marsupials, they don't maintain strong family ties. Females keep their young in pouches. Unlike many marsupials, males also have pouches, but these are to protect their genitals, not their young. Females produce about 10 viable joeys in a given breeding season, but only about four can expect to see more than a year of life. The average thylacine lives between 4 and 10 years.</p><p>Thylacines keep dens similar to those of plains mammals such as foxes and cougars. Dens are often very hard to find, in trees, caves, or other inconvenient locations out of the way of most predators, and in natural shade. Thylacine young reside in the den for only a short period, as joeys stay in their mothers' pouches for most of their development.</p><p>During periods when a mother is incubating her young, she can be downright violent to trespassers or any other potential threats.</p><p><strong>Regional Variants</strong><br /> Several breeds of thylacine are known to exist, hunting plains and woodlands in regions of Avistan, Garund, and beyond. Three of the most common are noted here.</p><p><strong>Blood Cougar:</strong> Not actually related to the big cats, Tian thylacines are known as blood cougars for their vivid red coloring. Surprisingly, they are often kept as pets by Tian-La leaders, as blood cougars are more easily domesticated and tamed, and serve as far better companions and hunting aids. Although they are slightly smaller than normal thylacines, they make up for it in ferocity and cunning. These red beasts have the advanced creature template (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 294).</p><p><strong>Casmar Thylacine:</strong> In Casmaron, most thylacines are smaller than the typical beast. For this reason, they tend to form larger packs, often twice the size of an average thylacine pack. These smaller beasts stand 6 inches to a foot shorter at the shoulders. Casmar thylacines are normal thylacines with the young creature template added (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 295), and gather in packs of 2-10.</p><p><strong>Sarusan Wolf:</strong> The Sarusan wolf is a slightly bigger and more doglike form of the normal thylacine. Whereas indigenous people refer to the thylacine as a lion or other great cat, the Sarusan wolf has an unmistakable canine jaw. While they are physically larger, Sarusan wolves are actually less hardy than their traditional cousins, due to poor weight allocation.

Related to deer, elk prove important parts of many ecologies, being able to fend off or flee many threats while feeding greater predators. Their size, strength, and antlers-reaching up to 10 feet wide on some males- allow them to contend with most of their environment's dangers, though herds generally favor flight to combat.</p><p>Elk also prove exceptionably adaptable and remarkable survivors, capable of living through severe changes in weather and in a variety of environments without concern.</p><p>Many humanoid cultures rely on elk herds, using them as valued food sources, work animals, and companions.</p><p>Most breeds of elk stand between 3 and 5 feet tall and weigh between 350 and 550 pounds, with females being far slighter than males. Heartier stock, such as the river elk seen throughout the River Kingdoms, Brevoy, and much of northern Avistan and Iobaria, grow to approximately 6 feet tall and weigh between 700 and 1,100 pounds. In some secluded wilds, primeval megaloceros-massive ancestors of the elk-still flourish, standing up to 9 feet tall, with bulks of 1,500 pounds and antlers growing over 12 feet wide.</p><p>In all species, only male elk grow antlers. Female elk have the same statistics as males, but lack the gore or powerful charge attacks.<strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong><br /> Elk live relatively long lives for herd animals, with some bulls living for over 15 years. Physiologically, they're similar to deer and other grazing animals with their patterns of travel and interaction with other creatures. Because of their size, though, they can damage an ecosystem, eating great amounts of food and sometimes competing with other herbivores for resources.</p><p>Bull elk keep their antlers for about 7 to 8 months of the year, maintaining them as a primary form of defense. The antlers of common elk stand 4 feet tall and spread about 6 feet wide. Both bulls and cows are quite strong, their kicks proving deadly deterrents against many would-be attackers.</p><p>Most breeds of elk stay in herds with upwards of 50 members. Herd members actively protect each other, doing what they can to defend those incapable of fleeing, yet also recognizing hopeless causes. Very few predators can stand up to a group of defensive elk, though wolves, bears, boars, and hunting cats often attack the young, sick, or unwary who venture away from the herd. While most natural predators steer clear of elk herds, many humanoid or monstrous hunters manage to pick off elk by relying on ranged weapons or great physical prowess.<strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong><br /> During most of the year, elk maintain large groups of their own genders. Cows and the young tend to stick near dens, so bulls are more likely to be found wandering their wide territories. During mating season, a dominant bull maintains a harem of as many as 20 cows. Any threat to that establishment is met with violent force, with battles between rivals often resulting in fierce clashing of antlers and contests of strength-though such rarely prove deadly. During mating season, cows don't always produce offspring, though when they do, typically only one or two elk are born.</p><p>After mating season, cows care for calves for only a short time. Most are only nursed for a couple of months before they join with the rest of the herd. Elk are hibernating creatures, being almost unheard of during the winter season. During the remainder of the year, they roam and graze widely. When they make their tell-tale noise (called bugling,) it booms and echoes for miles, and females often consider the loudest males the most suitable as mates.</p><p>Elk migrate throughout the year, typically to avoid the snow. They move from low to high ground, where tree bark is an abundant food source. During the summer months, they graze on the grasses they can find. During dry seasons, elk often make great trips to find abundant food sources, which can sometimes force out lesser creatures from a habitat.</p><p>Elk are also know to vary widely from region to region.</p><p>Common in Brevoy, the River Kingdoms, and secluded spots of Numeria, river elks prove larger and heartier than most of their brethren. Named for their tendencies to travel along rivers and the comfort with which they enter water, these elk exhibit a daring unknown to most other breeds, the bulls willingly fighting to defend their herds from any perceived threats.</p><p><strong>Megaloceros</strong><br /> Similar in form to the elk but far superior in size is the megaloceros. The average male is a towering, dangerous creature with antlers that can alone weigh nearly 100 pounds. Unlike elk, megaloceros antlers are decidedly enormous and sometimes wider than their bodies are long.</p><p>This leads to common misconceptions and exaggerations about the creature's monstrous size. Conveniently for those pursued, megaloceros males have difficultly navigating thickly forested areas, making them natives of plains and the woods' edge.</p><p><strong>Elk/Megaloceros Companions Starting Statistics: Size</strong> Medium; <strong>Speed</strong> 50 ft; <strong>AC</strong> +1 natural armor; <strong>Attack</strong> gore (1d6); <strong>Ability Scores</strong> Str 12, Dex 17, Con 14, Int 2, Wis 15, Cha 5; <strong>Special Qualities</strong> lowlight vision.</p><p><strong>7th-Level Advancement: Size</strong> Large; <strong>AC</strong> +2 natural armor; <strong>Attack</strong> gore (1d8) or 2 hooves (1d6); <strong>Ability Scores</strong> Str +8, Dex -2, Con +4; <strong>Special Qualities</strong> powerful charge.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Kingmaker.jpg","_id":"r83RaE9ngRT98iRJ"}

When his <i>time stop</i> ends, he telepathically commands the summoned astral deva to imperiously demand that the PCs leave this place, claiming that they tread upon the works of one under the protection of Heaven itself. This is, of course, a lie-the Wriggling Man doesn't expect the PCs to fall for it, but the tactic does amuse him and it could work, especially if the PCs don't ask to make Sense Motive checks to see through the angel's forced lie. If the PCs persist, the Wriggling Man telepathically orders the angel to attack the PCs, starting with a <i>blade barrier</i> and following up with melee attacks with its hammer. The Wriggling Man keeps in motion, flying around the room invisibly as a move action after each time he casts an attack spell on the PCs each round so that it's difficult to track his position. The Wriggling Man tries to avoid melee combat if possible, but if his magic manages to incapacitate a character, he won't be able to resist approaching to engulf the poor PC.</p><p><strong>Morale </strong>If the Wriggling Man's <i>contingency</i> activates, he uses <i>dimension door</i> to retreat to area M6. He waits until he's recovered, then casts <i>dimension door</i> to return to this room to start the attack anew-this time he fights to the death.</p></div><hr /><div><p><strong>STATISTICS</strong></p></div><hr /><div><p><strong>Str </strong>10, <strong>Dex </strong>22, <strong>Con </strong>16, <strong>Int </strong> 22, <strong>Wis </strong>16, <strong>Cha </strong>8</p><p><strong>Base Atk </strong>+8; <strong>CMB </strong>+8 (+16 grapple); <strong>CMD </strong>31</p><p><strong>Feats </strong>Arcane Armor Training, Combat Casting, Combat Expertise, Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Wondrous Item, Dodge, Greater Spell Focus, Improved Initiative, Light Armor Proficiency, Quicken Spell, Scribe Scroll, Spell Focus (transmutation), Toughness, Weapon Finesse</p><p><strong>Skills </strong>Bluff +16, Fly +26, Knowledge (arcana) +26, Knowledge (local) +26, Knowledge (nobility) +26, Perception +28, Sense Motive +28, Spellcraft +26, Stealth +31</p><p><strong>Languages </strong>Abyssal, Aklo, Common, Draconic, Sylvan, Terran, Undercommon</p><p><strong>SQ </strong>arcane bond (staff), <i>contingency</i>, physical enhancement (Dex +4), tenacious</p><p><strong>Combat Gear </strong><i>staff of transmutation</i>; <strong>Other Gear </strong><i>+4 fire resistant leather armor</i>, <i>amulet of natural armor +2</i>, <i>headband of mental prowess +2</i> (Int [fly], Wis), <i>ring of <i>invisibility</i></i>, <i>ring of protection +2</i>, <i>portable hole</i> (contains a small library, a reading desk, and all of his spellbooks-these books contain all of the wizard spells in the <i>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</i> save for Divination and Necromancy spells)</p></div><hr /><div><p><strong>SPECIAL ABILITIES</strong></p></div><hr /><div><p><strong><i>Contingency</i></strong> If the Wriggling Man's hit points drop below 30, a <i>dimension door</i> activates. </p><p><strong>Discorporate (Su)</strong> The Wriggling Man can collapse his body into a shapeless swarm of worms as a free action. He drops all held, worn, and carried items, and his Strength score changes to 1. He functions as a true swarm while discorporated, and has a reach of 0 feet (his space remains unchanged). While discorporated, he loses all of his defensive abilities but gains all of the standard swarm traits. He also loses his slam attack and all special abilities and special attacks, but can make a swarm attack that inflicts 5d6 points of damage. He can reform into his true form as a full-round action, as long as he has at least 1 hit point-doing so provokes an attack of opportunity. </p><p><strong>Engulf (Ex)</strong> If the Wriggling Man successfully grapples a foe, he can engulf that foe as soon as the attempt to grapple succeeds. He then sends a large number of the worms that comprise his body to swarm over the grappled creature. He can only engulf one target per round. These worms inflict 5d6 points of damage per round. The damage caused by an engulf attack is treated as swarm damage for the purposes of what creatures it can affect. Any creature damaged by this engulf attack is also subjected to distraction, and must make a DC 21 Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1 round. The save DC is Constitution-based. </p><p><strong>Grab (Ex)</strong> The Wriggling Man can use his grab attack on targets that are no more than one size category larger than himself. </p><p><strong>Tenacious (Ex)</strong> The Wriggling Man gains a +8 racial bonus on CMB checks made to grapple a foe, rather than the normal +4 racial bonus granted to most creatures with the grab special attack. In addition, he gains a +4 racial bonus to his CMD. </p><p><strong>Worm That Walks Traits</strong> The Wriggling Man has no discernable anatomy, and is not subject to critical hits or flanking. He can be damaged normally by weapons (such blows scattering worms or temporarily disrupting a portion of its body), but damage is mitigated normally by fast healing and damage reduction. Reducing him to 0 hit points forces him to discorporate-at 0 hit points he is staggered, and at negative hit points he is dying. He is immune to any spell or effect that targets a specific number of creatures (including single-target spells such as <i>disintegrate</i>), with the exception of such spells and effects generated by himself, which treat him as a single creature if he so chooses. Mind-affecting effects that target single creatures also function normally against him since his individual components share one hivemind in common. He takes half again as much damage (+50%) from spells or effects that affect an area, such as <i>splash</i> weapons and many evocation spells. The Wriggling Man is susceptible to high winds-treat him as a Fine creature for the purposes of determining the effects of wind.</p></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Kingmaker.jpg","_id":"s4g6cuaX1sjOTqwA"}

This ability takes effect regardless of whether or not the spell overcomes the dweomercat's spell resistance. If it chooses, the dweomercat can immediately make a full attack against the spell's caster as though pouncing. Using this ability does not provoke an attack of opportunity. If there is no safe space adjacent to the caster-or if the dweomercat chooses-the dweomercat can forgo using this ability.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Powerful and regal, dweomercats stalk the First World, preying upon lesser creatures, but more voraciously hunting new and ever stranger sources of magic. Beings as much composed of sculpted arcane eddies as of flesh and blood, these capricious felines flourish along the intangible ley lines of their home realm, drinking in its weird powers as a plant thrives on light. Yet even more potent than their thirst for magic and the euphoria they draw from being in proximity to the reshaping of reality is dweomercats' racial curiosity, which leads them endlessly across the First World-and often beyond. The average adult dweomercat is about 4 feet tall and 7 feet long, weighing over 250 pounds, while their cubs are approximately 1 foot tall and weigh no more than 15 pounds.<strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p> A newly born dweomercat cub is connected to its homeland by only a thin tether of fey magic, and can only tap into its true potential during the instant a spell is cast upon it. The burst of magical energy brought forth by a freshly cast spell momentarily intensifies the bond between the First World and the dweomercat. This link manifests itself clumsily as a sort of sudden teleportation that heaves the fey cat through space and time toward the source of the spell, fueled by the magnetic reaction between the dweomercat and the magic's origin. A dweomercat grows not by the passage of time, but through direct exposure to fey magic. Thus, a dweomercat cub on the Material Plane is stunted developmentally. Though it ages and gains experience and practical wisdom anywhere, only by spending several lifetimes on the First World can the cub reach adulthood. Once it has reached this stage, however, a fully grown dweomercat may freely travel between its native land and the Material Plane without adverse effects.<strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p> In the First World, dweomercats travel in packs while hunting. Beyond this predatory advantage, however, they have little use for organized society, as the evershifting nature of their homeland impedes it anyway. Dweomercats that are born on or come to be stranded on the Material Plane are often forced to live on their own. Cut off from the direct magical eddies of the First World, dweomercat cubs prove unable to grow into adults. While they might become slightly stronger and more learned, they never reach the size and prowess of those constantly subjected to the magic of their homeland. Were a dweomercat cub to return to the First World, it would eventually grow into a normal dweomercat, but only over the course of numerous humanoid lifespans. Those dweomercats marooned on the Material Plane seek out areas of great age, changeability, and magical potency- lands most like the First World. Sometimes this means not a specific place, but rather a period spent journeying with a mortal spellcaster. While an adult dweomercat would scoff at the idea of following a humanoid's orders, adolescents see the benefit of journeying alongside an intelligent creature native to the alien world. Should a dweomercat cub find a magic-user reckless or whimsical enough to keep its attention, it might join the caster as a familiar, gaining a measure of constant magical exposure from the intangible connection inherent in such a mystical relationship.<br /><strong>Dweomercat Cubs as Familiars </strong><br />Attracted to flashy displays of magic and the strange powers inherent in a bond between a magic-user and her familiar, a dweomercat cub that's wandered from the First World might find its taste for magic and adventure satisfied in the service of a particularly whimsical or ostentatious arcane spellcaster. A spellcaster with the Improved Familiar feat can acquire a chaotic neutral dweomercat cub at 7th level or higher. Should the spellcaster settle into a life of research and predictability for a span of months, the dweomercat cub familiar might take to wandering off and, eventually, might not return-deliberately severing the master-familiar bond and freeing the spellcaster to summon a new familiar.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Kingmaker.jpg","_id":"vIoRvEoTHtEsvMOc"}

While holding or otherwise in contact with a gemstone of at least the size of a human eye, a stygira can see through the gemstone like a magical eye, viewing her surroundings as if her blindsense extended to 120 feet and she were under the <i>effect</i>s of <i>true seeing</i>, which grants her a +4 bonus on Perception checks. </p><p><strong>Gem Gaze (Su)</strong> Shaken for 1d4 rounds, 30 feet, Fortitude DC 16 negates.

This curse proves frighteningly unpredictable, forcing another <i>save</i> against its <i>effect</i>s every 1d3 hours. Any creature that is drained to 0 Dexterity or fails three <i>save</i>s against the curse is permanently petrified. Even if a creature is petrified and then restored to flesh, it is still affected by the curse and is petrified again upon failing its next <i>save</i> against the curse. A stone curse can only be removed in one of two ways: by casting <i>remove curse</i> or by spending a full hour in unobstructed natural sunlight. Magical radiance like <i>daylight</i> does not affect a stone curse, and <i>remove curse</i> does not return a petrified creature to flesh. The <i>save</i> DC is Constitution-based. <i>Stone curse:</i> Claw-curse; <i>save</i> Will DC 18; <i>frequency</i> 1/1d3 hours; <i>effect</i> 1d6 Dex damage, failing 3 <i>save</i>s results in petrification; <i>cure</i> casting <i>remove curse</i> or spending 1 hour in natural sunlight</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Withered hermits wrapped in tattered black rags, these scarred, eyeless crones slip through the dark crevasses of both earth and time. Degenerate inheritors of the half-remembered, collapsed cyclops civilizations, the stygiras-or stone witches, as they are often called- command strange secrets of the earth and interpret the fateful energies of the depths. Ages of communion with the darkness and reliance upon alien magics have corrupted the stygiras from the primitive human witches their ancestors were countless ages ago, transforming them into a terrifying, debased breed infused with magics not their own. In many a savage land, these crones were once or are still worshiped as seers and demigods, weaving magic and communing with the earth to manipulate their servants into obeying their selfish and grotesque whims. In other realms, they haunt the night, prowling from their caves to feed upon the unwary or make alliances with those cruel and ambitious enough to believe their perverse counsel. Yet for all their perverse blasphemies and primitive desires, their powers to see what none should and reduce life to brittle stone proves enough to inspire dread and superstitious belief in nearly all who hear of the harsh stone witches. Stygiras on average stand 6-1/2 feet tall and weigh approximately 150 pounds.<strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p> It is said that the stygiras draw their power from stone and from the darkness. Certainly they live their entire lives in the dark, traveling through intricate, maze-like caverns and the moonless sky with equal ease. They draw their sustenance from the base things they scrape from the earth-vermin, molds, lichens, and whatever fleshy things happen into their lairs. Although technically blind, stygiras have almost supernaturally keen hearing, taste, and touch, and so have no need for sight. What remains of the eyes that lurk as vestigial elements of their anatomy hide beneath the scarred flesh of their faces. While such remnant organs typically go unused, they can still detect the presence of light, an uncomfortable sensation that all stygiras take great pains to avoid. Stygiras can in fact travel under the skies, but they quickly become agoraphobic and retreat to the safety of shadowy canyons or caves as soon as possible. They avoid the sunlight hours, with most willing to face death in the darkness rather than take their chances venturing into the light. All stygiras are female; they are capable of reproducing with humanoids of nearly any species and always bearing three or more withered-and typically stillborn-stygira young. Yet stygiras make up for their appallingly low live birth and survival rates with unnaturally long lifespans. None can say how long stygiras who don't meet their end by violence might live, but instances of stone witches living for 3 or more centuries are well documented.<strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p> Stygiras most commonly occupy lands near the phenomenally ancient tombs and monuments of the cyclops empires. While some of the crazed witches make the impossible claim that all stygira are the surviving mortal apprentices of primordial cyclops seers, saner minds posit that the predecessors of these crones were primitive human shamans and mystics who managed to tap into a degree of the fallen empires' powers.
