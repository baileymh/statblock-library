Among these wretched creations are the spider-like shriezyx (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 4</i> 244), which remain a constant threat to explorers venturing into the heart of Hollow Mountain, the ruins of Xin-Bakrakhan at the mountain's base, and the Irespan in the nearby city of Magnimar. While shriezyx made excellent soldiers and guardians, they made poor servants, in part because of their unnatural fear of fire (a particular problem for Alaznist's armies and devotees, who relied heavily on evocation magic). The same immunity to mental control that defended them against enchantments from the rival realm of Eurythnia also made them impossible to magically control by their own general. To solve this problem, Alaznist's skilled fleshwarpers created a superior version of the shriezyx-a queen that could serve as <i>command</i>er to lesser shriezyx and ensure complete loyalty among the verminous minions.  A typical shriezyx queen is roughly 8 feet in length and weighs as much as 1,000 pounds.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p> Although its name is something of a misnomer due to the shriezyx's method of asexual reproduction, a shriezyx queen nevertheless maintains a position among other shriezyx analogous to that of a bee or ant queen. Rather than existing to grow the hive, a shriezyx queen was instead created to control, <i>command</i>, and-when necessary-overpower lesser shriezyx. A shriezyx queen exudes a strong supernatural pheromone that calms her subjects, especially around fire. A shriezyx queen is also singularly capable of using mind-affecting effects on other shriezyx, to work them into a frenzy before a battle or to ensure their obedience.  A shriezyx queen can use her incendiary webs to turn her fire vulnerability against enemies that may hope to employ flame against a shriezyx hive. Many alchemists and evokers have fallen victim to a shriezyx queen's oily webs when deploying fire attacks.  Shriezyx queens are inveterate schemers, with intellects far superior to those of standard shriezyx. Although shriezyx queens use this intellect to protect their hive, they also work to obscure knowledge of their existence. Only the most learned Thassilonian scholars know that a queen caste exists above the common shriezyx. While dozens of shriezyx hives exist throughout western Varisia-most known to locals for the threat they pose- only the queen of the hive living at the base of Hollow Mountains has ever revealed herself to civilized peoples.  A shriezyx queen refers to her hive as her brood, despite not being the genetic matriarch of the lesser members of her species. A queen replicates herself via asexual reproduction in the same manner a standard shriezyx does-with an unfertilized egg that produces an identical spawn-but she often keeps her dormant egg in a secure place deep in the heart of the hive's lair for centuries before it hatches. Thus, the number of shriezyx queens in existence at any time remains fairly static. Upon a queen's death, her hive generally turns feral or breaks up entirely before her replacement hatches from its well-hidden egg. The newly hatched queen retains some of the memories of her predecessor in the form of racial instincts to cultivate a hive, but she must spend the first dozen or more years of her life reuniting the remnants of her predecessor's brood. When a predecessor's hive has been entirely eradicated-such as in the wake of Earthfall or another cataclysm-the new queen instead seeks out all the dormant eggs she can find to revive the shriezyx from the brink of extinction.  Larger and stronger than the ave<i>rage</i> shriezyx, a queen requires more food and thus often sends her brood to hunt for her. All shriezyx have preternaturally variable metabolisms, which provide them rapid regeneration from wounds and also the ability to go long stretches with very little sustenance. A queen's appetite is as much a function of her role within the hive as it is her physiology, and even the smallest shriezyx queen appears corpulent when compared to her smaller minions.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Despite their influential role within hive society, shriezyx queens live solitary lives, forever unique among their kin. Two shriezyx  queens rarely meet one another, each tasked by their design with managing disparate hives. Shriezyx queens limit contact with underlings, except to issue orders or to orchestrate attacks during times of open conflict with the hive's enemies. A queen spends her solitary hours stewing on her plots for returning her hive-or herself-to a position of prominence in the region, but she invariably produces convoluted, overwrought plans that she never finds the opportunity to act on.  A queen that does interact with members of another species-whether they're allies of fallen Bakrakhan (normally demons, giants, or sinspawnB2) or members of modern societies now living in or near the shriezyx's ruined lair-is likely to be quite verbose. After centuries of loneliness, most queens are overwhelmed by the idea of conversing with an intellectual equal, and they see such opportunities as a rare chances to implement long-delayed plans. Humanoids often find such conversations off-putting, both because the shriezyx are such horrific works of arcane mutation and because few adventurers would ever expect to encounter chatty monstrosities when exploring millennia-old ruins.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Return_of_the_Runelords.jpg","_id":"04qLtOqfRRKSTcw8"}

A creature that starts its turn in the affected area must succeed at a DC 26 Reflex save or be unable to move. A creature that fails this save by 5 or more is knocked prone; a flying creature falls instead. Casting a spell in this area requires a successful concentration check (DC = 15 + the level of the spell being cast). All other concentration checks in the area have their DCs increased by 5. The DC of Perception checks is likewise increased by 5. The effects of this ability last until the start of the sturzstromer's next turn. The save DCs are Strength-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Sturzstromers, also known as living landslides, are the elemental incarnations of earth in motion, from crushing rockfalls to landscape-altering avalanches. A sturzstromer consists of hundreds of stones, each moving of its own volition. When at rest, the stones lie atop one another; when the sturzstromer moves, the stones roll and churn, drawing smaller pebbles and dirt into their mass. Some observers are able to discern faces in the textures and colors of these rocks.  The individual rocks that compose a sturzstromer are roughly a foot in diameter, though often irregularly shaped, and weigh approximately 80 pounds each. Altogether, a sturzstromer weighs around 12 tons, and when formed into a pile, the peak reaches 5 feet high.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p> A sturzstromer consists of several hundred rocks each able to move independently. It is unclear to scholars whether a sturzstromer is made up of a mob of tiny elementals working in unison, or whether it is a single elemental spirit divided among countless bodies. Some sages speculate that when a powerful being of elemental earth is destroyed, its shattered remains reanimate in the form of a sturzstromer.  A sturzstromer can be composed of any sort of common rock, though all of its constituent stones will be of the same type. The type of rock invariably matches a type common to the area where the creature lives. A sturzstromer that has  lost stones (often due to damage) can replace them with stones from its environment, infusing them with the same elemental spirit that animates the sturzstromer.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Sturzstromers dwell in only the largest caverns of the Elemental Plane of Earth. Here they can spend decades, even centuries, raising mountains of earth and stone, only to bring them crashing to the ground in the blink of an eye. Although strurzstromers do not seek out companions, other earth elementals are sometimes drawn to them, aiding the living landslide in its creative and destructive endeavors. Some monastic oreads and shaitans view the sturzstromer's efforts as a metaphor for sublimation and catharsis. Due to how long it takes for sturzstromers to build their mountains, their constructed landscapes often become inhabited, usually by creatures unaware of the inevitable catastrophe.  A sturzstromer is unlikely to travel to the Material Plane intentionally or even by accident. Those that exist on Golarion were conjured in ages past by powerful ritual magic. Whether to cause mayhem or to accelerate entropy, cultists of Ayrzul, Groetus, and Rovagug have called sturzstromers or attempted to magically dominate those previously conjured. Living landslides do not take well to being controlled, and this has been the downfall of many cults.  Though others may see them as a destructive force of nature, sturzstromers view themselves as artists creating beauty in the rise and (especially) fall of mountains.  <br /><strong>VARIANT STURZSTROMERS </strong><br /> Sturzstromers can form from any sort of stone, from sedimentary to igneous. Some sturzstromers contain traces of cold iron or silver ore, allowing them to overcome the corresponding damage reduction. The following variants emerge from those regions where two Elemental Planes overlap.  <br /><strong>Glacial:</strong> Though similar in many ways to a true sturzstromer, a glacial sturzstromer is composed of chunks of ice and snow. Hailing from the border between the Elemental Planes of Air and Water, they are found only upon snowy peaks on the Material Plane. A glacial sturzstromer has the same statistics as a normal sturzstromer except as follows: It loses the earth subtype and gains the cold and water subtypes. It loses all energy resistance, but it gains immunity to cold and vulnerability to fire. A glacial sturzstromer can use its landslide ability after taking either fire or sonic damage, and its mountaineer ability applies to  snow and ice instead of rocky terrain. It speaks Auran and Aquan instead of Terran, and can use its <i>stone tell</i> ability to speak with snow and ice instead of stone.  <br /><strong>Pyroclastic:</strong> Dwelling near the border between the Elemental Planes of Earth and Fire, pyroclastic sturzstromers can only be called to the Material Plane from active volcanoes. Though other sturzstromers may consist of volcanic rock, pyroclastic sturzstromers retain molten heat. A pyroclastic sturzstromer has the same statistics as a normal sturzstromer except as follows: It gains the fire subtype in addition to the earth subtype. It loses all energy resistance but gains immunity to fire and vulnerability to cold. Its attacks, including avalanches it creates, deal 2d6 fewer points of bludgeoning damage, but deal an additional 2d6 fire damage plus burn (2d6, DC 30). A pyroclastic sturzstromer can use its landslide ability after taking either cold or sonic damage. It speaks Ignan in addition to Terran.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Return_of_the_Runelords.jpg","_id":"1tiQgq49zq9tisVF"}

Enemies in the light at the start of the lynx's turn must succeed at a DC 26 Will save or become blinded for 1 round.

Only a handful of hallowed lynxes exist, most held in stasis within long-buried Thassilonian ruins, though rumored sightings of the blindingly bright cats suggest that small populations may have survived to the present day. Created from keen hunters and imbued with potent light-based magic distilled from powerful outsiders, hallowed lynxes are deadly predators whose mere presence bolsters their allies. Aside from the brilliant orbs that surround them, a hallowed lynx resembles its mundane kin, having a short tail, large paws, spotted tawny fur, and distinctive tufts of fur extending from its ears. It is the same size as an ordinary lynx: just over 2 feet tall, around 3 feet long, and weighing about 35 pounds.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p> Hallowed lynxes are not natural creatures, though they are descended from the mundane lynxes still found across Varisia. Their origin can be traced to the height of the Thassilonian empire in the realm of Eurythnia, where the runelord Sorshen created the first hallowed lynxes to serve her as favored pets and guardians similar to the way in which animals served the gods.  Creating the original hallowed lynxes involved powerful conjuration magic, wherein the terrible creatures known as shining children were summoned and bound into the physical form of a living lynx. The outsiders' intellect bolstered that of the host, and the host channeled the outsiders' magic and light for its own benefit. The shining children continue a half-existence after their integration  orbiting the hallowed lynx and shedding their light as a powerful aura. A hallowed lynx can utilize this energy in one of two ways: either hurling the orbs at a foe, or temporarily releasing shining children from within the orbs.  While several other creatures were also magically \"hallowed\" in a similar manner during Sorshen's rule, the hallowed lynx was by far her favorite, eventually spreading beyond her court as demand for the creatures grew among Thassilonian nobility. These noble felines served as pets and guardians for the realm's elite, their owners benefitting from the same aura that made the creatures so effective against intruders and foes. The small size of hallowed lynxes made them ideal indoor pets but still large enough to present a significant threat to anyone or anything that crossed their path. As status symbols, hallowed lynxes typically led plush, pampered lives in which their stalking and hunting was conducted for their own amusement rather than sustenance. More intelligent than a common lynx, a hallowed lynx can- with sufficient exposure-understand the languages spoken around it, and it can perform far more complex tasks than its mundane kin; though, as with most felines, it can be challenging to convince a hallowed lynx that undertaking a given effort is worth its time.  Scattered historical records, most of which were poorly kept to begin with, make it difficult to determine how many hallowed lynxes were created within the empire, but historians agree the number was exceptionally low, and likely only in the hundreds. Given their scarcity even at their peak, scholars conclude that hallowed lynxes met their end along with the empire that created them. Today, the creatures are known from only a handful of surviving mosaics, engravings, and other artwork, and occasional references in written documents that have connected the image with their name.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Much like other lynxes, the hallowed lynx is a solitary creature. Some form bonds with their keepers, with records suggesting that Sorshen had a particularly powerful hallowed lynx that followed her as dutifully as any of the runelord's sycophants. But even within the empire that created them, it was rare for hallowed lynxes to encounter one another due to their scarcity, and such encounters have become rarer still since the empire's fall.  Being savvy and sturdy creatures, however, not all hallowed lynxes perished during Earthfall. A few were caught up in the Thassilonians' various efforts  to survive the catastrophe, held in stasis or otherwise preserved within the homes and temples they once prowled. A few others escaped, fleeing the collapse of Thassilonian civilization and taking shelter deep in the forests of Varisia. The persistence of the hallowed lynx as a creature in rumors and folktales suggests that the creatures managed to survive and reproduce, yet they remain so rare and hide themselves so well that their existence remains unconfirmed. Whether the creatures simply seek to remain hidden for their own safety or whether they're guarding long-buried secrets of Thassilon has yet to be determined.  Few predators-natural or otherwise-pose a serious threat to a hallowed lynx. Their small size and unambitious nature places them below the notice of tyrants and chromatic dragons, but they are tremendously powerful creatures in their own right, apex predators in those few habitats where they remain. If cornered, confronted, or challenged, a hallowed lynx first hurls its blinding orbs in an attempt to debilitate its foes, then pounces to attack its target's weak points. Against multiple foes, it releases the shining children bound to it and flanks foes, or else it employs its spell-like abilities to weaken, distract, and entrance enemies.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Return_of_the_Runelords.jpg","_id":"3UrEWTZiidfc7GSP"}

A creature struck by the shade's incorporeal touch must also save against this effect. Once a creature is affected, it remains shaken as long as it remains within 30 feet of the choking shade. This fear effect does not stack with other fear effects. A successful DC 17 Will save negates the effect. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Gravedust (Su)</strong> As a standard action, a choking shade can enter the lungs of an adjacent living creature that is under the influence of a fear effect (such as the effect brought on by its desperation aura), bringing with it the dust of the grave. The victim can resist this attack with a successful DC 16 Fortitude save, and the choking shade is instantly  expelled from a victim's lungs as soon as the victim is no longer under the effect of a fear effect (for example, because the victim has left the radius of the choking shade's aura or succeeded on the Will save). Until that point, the victim is prevented from breathing or speaking while the undead occupies its lungs. A creature can attempt to cough the shade out of its lungs on its turn as a standard action, but it must succeed at a DC 16 Fortitude save to do so. See page 445 of the <i>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</i> for rules on how long a victim can hold its breath and the consequences of eventual suffocation.  </p><p><strong>Susceptible to Wind (Ex)</strong> A choking shade is treated as a Tiny corporeal creature for the purposes of determining the effects high wind has upon it.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>There is nothing quite like the desperation of a suffocating creature, frantic for one last, sweet breath of air to fill deprived, aching lungs; it is a terrible way to die. There are so many ways to die of suffocation: asphyxiation in a fire, being buried alive, crucifixion, disease, drowning, strangulation-the list seems endless. Sometimes, the terrible imminence filling a person as life ends in so cruel a manner is enough to cause the doomed soul to rise from death as a choking shade.  Choking shades animate into a swirling swarm of ashes, bone shards, dirt, and dust, assuming a facsimile of a humanoid form. They have a brutish intelligence and are drawn with envy to the breath of living creatures, attacking them on sight. In addition to the dust of the grave, these hateful spirits carry with them the overwhelming fear that accompanied them in their suffocating deaths, and this aura infects those who are near them with this same terror. Choking shades can take advantage of those affected by their fearful auras (or those already under the influence of a fear effect): they enter the victim's lungs, carrying their dusty remains with them, threatening unwilling hosts with the same awful deaths that they endured. Anyone slain by the choking essence of these undead creatures rises as one of their number, seeking retribution for all who are still afforded the freedom to breathe, a luxury taken for granted by the living.  Though choking shades have some measure of intelligence and understand the languages they knew in life, their unreasoning hatred of the living makes communication with them impossible: these spirits would much rather make even a futile assault on the lungs of the living than engage in any form of communication.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p> Upon rising from death, a choking shade has a tendency to remain near either its grave or the site of its demise. It is not uncommon for these hateful spirits to manifest  in a lethal, predatory pack, especially if they died together in the same tragic event. Choking shades who drowned and whose bodies remained in the water most often seek out dry land, but they tend to remain near that body of water, haunting the shoreline in search of potential victims.  The threat of choking shades has affected the safety of miners and builders for generations. When miners are killed in a cave-in or laborers crushed by a collapsing structure, wise city managers and foremen seek the aid of the clergy to ensure the bodies are excavated and given proper burials. Clerics are often posted to spend some nights at the place of such an unfortunate event as a precaution against an undead infestation at the work site. Laying to rest these desperate, hatefully aggressive spirits is in the service of all those who still draw breath. The most common ritual for this purpose ends by extinguishing a blessed candle, respectfully putting out a flame that feeds on the oxygen the dead were denied.  <br /><strong>VARIANT CHOKING SHADES</strong><br />  While these several variants of choking shades differ primarily by the nature of their suffocating deaths, the intensity of those deaths and the circumstances of their lives when the air was taken from their lungs make some shades even stronger and fiercer. At minimum, all variants have the advanced template as well as alterations to the gravedust special ability, modified by the circumstances of their deaths. Four are noted below.  <br /><strong>Crushed Shade:</strong> Suffocation following a cave-in or the collapse of a structure creates these shades. When a crushed shade is expelled from a host's lungs, the victim must succeed at a Will save against the gravedust's DC or be cursed by a permanent form of claustrophobia: whenever the victim is about to enter a cramped space, crowded venue, or other place from which escape may be difficult, she becomes shaken. The victim can attempt a DC 14 Will save to negate this condition, but failure makes the condition persistent. Even if the victim endures the claustrophobic circumstances with the shaken, frightened, or panicked condition and the threat passes (the crowded disperses or flees, the obstacle is surmounted or avoided), the condition persists until she succeeds at the appropriate saves. This is a curse effect.  <br /><strong>Drowned Shade:</strong> Those choking shades whose suffocating deaths occurred in water are even more dreadful. When they are driven from a victim, the muck of  the grave remains within the lungs. Victims are nauseated for 1d4 rounds after a drowned shade exits their lungs.  <br /><strong>Smoking Shade:</strong> Smoke inhalation within a fire caused the deaths of these choking shades. Each round a smoking shade occupies the lungs of a host, that host also takes 1d4 points of fire damage. After the choking shade is expelled, the victim is staggered from the pain for 1 round.  <br /><strong>Strangled Shade:</strong> A strangled shade was asphyxiated by a murderer, and when it invades a victim's lungs, hand-shaped bruises arise on the victim's throat. Each round a strangled shade occupies a host, the victim takes 1d4 points of bludgeoning damage, and after the strangled shade is expelled from the lungs, the victim can't speak until an hour passes or receiving any amount of magical healing (whichever comes first).</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Return_of_the_Runelords.jpg","_id":"3dHIihD0c70IFFii"}

These nobles competed with one another in decking out the approaches to their palaces with outlandish and lethal guardians, and the avian ivory sentinels served this purpose well. Often employed to terrorize peasants and foreign dignitaries, most of these constructs were destroyed during Earthfall when those extravagant palaces came tumbling down.  When an ivory sentinel takes flight, delicate wings carved to resemble those of a bird unfurl from the sides of its skull-like head.    Ivory Sentinel <br /><strong>Construction</strong><br />  Though the exact process of creating the base form differs depending on the materials involved, the process of animating sentinels is roughly the same, regardless of the specific type of sentinel being created.

All creatures within the area have concealment. A strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the ash after 1 round. The ash returns immediately once the strong wind ends.  </p><p><strong>Earthen Regeneration (Ex)</strong> Mhar's regeneration functions only while it is burrowing, submerged in lava, or otherwise underground. The regeneration continues for 1 minute after it emerges aboveground. If Mhar's regeneration is stopped, the regeneration automatically resumes when Mhar burrows or enters lava.  </p><p><strong>Immortality (Ex)</strong> If Mhar is slain, it explodes violently, spraying earth and lava in all directions. Creatures within 30 feet of Mhar take 30d6 points of bludgeoning damage and 30d6 points of fire damage. A creature can attempt a DC 40 Reflex save for half damage. Mhar manifests again 1 year later in the same area, restored to life via <i>true resurrection</i>.  </p><p><strong>Massive (Ex)</strong> Due to Mhar's tremendous size, it treats uneven ground and other terrain features that form difficult terrain as normal terrain, though areas of forest or significant settlements are still considered difficult terrain to Mhar. A Huge or smaller creature can move through any square occupied by Mhar, and vice versa. Mhar can make attacks of opportunity only against foes that are Huge or larger, and can be flanked only by Huge or larger foes. Mhar gains a bonus for being on higher ground only if its entire space is on higher ground than that of its target. It's possible for a Huge or smaller creature to climb Mhar-this generally requires a successful DC 30 Climb check, and unlike the normal rules regarding Mhar and attacks of opportunity, a Small or larger creature that climbs on its body provokes an attack of opportunity from Mhar. Any creature that climbs on Mhar is treated as if it is totally immersed in lava (<i>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</i> 444).  </p><p><strong>Taphophobic Dreams (Su)</strong> When Mhar uses its <i>nightmare</i> spell-like ability on a creature within 5 feet of earth or worked stone, it also afflicts that creature with terrifying dreams of an immense presence surging through the ground, ominously circling the target and threatening to pull it under. In addition to the effects of <i>nightmare</i>, the target must also succeed at a DC 35 Will save or be unwilling to approach within 5 feet of any amount of earth or stone and, if within such an area, compelled to leave it immediately. The creature is profoundly uncomfortable in such an area, reducing its Dexterity score to 1. This is a mind-affecting curse effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Unspeakable Presence (Su)</strong> Failing a DC 35 Will save against Mhar's unspeakable presence causes the victim to  experience the crushing entombment of earth and lose the ability to breathe as long as it remains within the area of effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Volcanic Tempest (Ex)</strong> Once every 1d6 rounds, Mhar can spew a torrential rain of lava, fire, and caustic ash as a full-round action. All creatures within 60 feet of Mhar take 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage and 8d6 points of fire damage (DC 40 Reflex half). In addition, the ground within 60 feet of Mhar when it uses this ability becomes covered in a thin layer of lava. Any creature that ends its turn within this lava takes 20d6 points of fire damage. The lava cools after 1 minute. Finally, the area within 60 feet of Mhar when it uses this ability fills with deadly ash that functions as <i>stinking cloud</i> (Fortitude DC 40 negates). This ash disperses naturally after 1 minute. The save DCs are Constitution-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Mhar is a Great Old One that was born eons ago on the edge of the Material Plane. A unique planar rift caused pure essence from the Plane of Earth and Plane of Fire to collide and fuse together, coalescing into a being that lived in a state of constant anguish-a mass of volcanic eruptions that cooled and melted away in a cycle that caused it unending pain. Seeking relief from its torment but unable to escape the Material Plane, Mhar alleviated its suffering by traveling the stars.  Mhar found nascent planets that were still made of roiling magma. For a time, Mhar could rest in the core of these planets, but even such primordial heat could not keep Mhar sedated. Mhar would eventually awaken, destroying the planet and departing to find another haven elsewhere. After destroying countless worlds, Mhar learned a way to escape to the Elemental Plane of Fire. Unfortunately for Mhar, this required greater power than it currently had. Mhar found another young planet-the world called Golarion-burrowed deep into its core, and waited to grow.  While Mhar rested, the goddess Sarenrae tore open a portion of the Material Plane to seal Rovagug within the Dead Vault. Unbeknownst to her, she slew Mhar in that process, granting it the reprieve from pain it had always sought. However, even oblivion could not quell Mhar's suffering, and its agony was enough to stir it from death. When Mhar awakened yet again, trapped within the crust of Golarion, it went mad, unable to escape its own torment. Mhar let out a psychic scream. As this scream rebounded and echoed between the crust and  Mhar itself, intensifying the creature's madness, the mental force of it pushed against the surface of the earth and formed the Kodar Mountains.  Mhar seeks to break free from beneath Golarion's crust and destroy the world, then use the magma as a focus to open a breach to the Plane of Fire and flood the entire Material Plane with lava. Once all of reality is a mass of fire and destruction, Mhar can finally find peace.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Return_of_the_Runelords.jpg","_id":"6CFu4Q10dbRAulhT"}

This takes no action from Zutha but expends the spells from his list as if he had cast them normally. The spells cast in this fashion are <i>false life</i>, <i>fly</i>, and <i>mage armor</i>.</p><p><strong>During Combat </strong>Zutha's fragment has full knowledge of the runelord's combat tactics and spellcasting but little concept of the world beyond the Tarnished Temple. This allows him to fight the PCs effectively but prevents him from attempting to simply flee a fight to try to establish himself elsewhere in the world (something he'd not be able to do anyway, considering the 1-minute duration of his manifestation).  His first act in combat is to <i>fly</i> into the air to put some distance between himself and his foes, after which he casts quickened <i>displacement</i> and then <i>finger of death</i> on the primary caster of the runewaking ritual. During the second round, Zutha casts quickened <i>mirror image</i> and another <i>finger of death</i> on the character that posed the greatest threat to him on the previous round. During the third round, he casts quickened <i>blindness/deafness</i> on a ranged combatant, along with <i>disintegrate</i>. He continues to rely on range or invisibility to protect himself in following rounds, resorting to attacks with his <i><i>+1 conductive</i> scythe</i> only if he faces a single foe or hopes to paralyze someone who is particularly vexing.</p><p><strong>Morale </strong>Zutha's fragment fights until destroyed, or until it fades away after the runewaking ritual's 1-minute duration ends.</p></div><hr /><div><p><strong>STATISTICS</strong></p></div><hr /><div><p><strong>Str </strong>19, <strong>Dex </strong>16, <strong>Con </strong>-, <strong>Int </strong> 24, <strong>Wis </strong>20, <strong>Cha </strong>26</p><p><strong>Base Atk </strong>+6; <strong>CMB </strong>+10; <strong>CMD </strong>29</p><p><strong>Feats </strong>Combat Casting, Combat Expertise, Empower Spell, Eschew Materials, Greater Spell Focus (necromancy), Improved Initiative, Martial Weapon Proficiency (scythe), Quicken Spell, Scribe Scroll, Spell Focus (necromancy), Toughness, Turn Undead</p><p><strong>Skills </strong>Fly +19, Intimidate +24, Knowledge (arcana) +23, Knowledge (nobility) +23, Knowledge (planes) +23, Knowledge (religion) +23, Perception +29, Sense Motive +29, Spellcraft +23, Stealth +11, Use Magic Device +21</p><p><strong>Languages </strong>Abyssal, Aklo, Azlanti, Draconic, Giant, Shoanti, Varisian</p><p><strong>SQ </strong>arcane bond (<i><i>+1 conductive</i> scythe</i>), enhanced ability scores, power over undead, shadowy remnants</p><p><strong>Gear </strong>shadow gear</p></div><hr /><div><p><strong>SPECIAL ABILITIES</strong></p></div><hr /><div><p><strong>Contingency (Sp)</strong> Zutha's fragment has the benefit of a <i>contingency</i> spell in effect whenever he is manifested by the runewaking ritual. This <i>contingency</i> spell causes a <i>greater invisibility</i> spell to activate on Zutha if he takes damage. Both the <i>contingency</i> and the <i>greater invisibility</i> spell function at CL 20th.  </p><p><strong>Enhanced Ability Scores (Ex)</strong> As with the other runelords, Zutha used <i>wish</i> spells to increase his ability scores. This fragment retains an echo of those effects and has a +4 inherent bonus to its Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores.  </p><p><strong>Shadow Gear (Ex)</strong> When completed, the runewaking ritual equips Zutha's fragment with shadowy reflections of his favored magic items-his scythe and his rings. In this form, Zutha's scythe functions as a <i>+1 conductive</i> scythe (which also functions as his arcane bond), while the combination of his rings gives him a +5 deflection bonus to his Armor Class, a +1 insight bonus to his Armor Class, a +3 resistance bonus on saving throws, and a +2 enhancement bonus to his Charisma score. These effects are intrinsic parts of his being-if one of his rings or his scythe is lost, dropped, or removed, it turns to shadows and <i>vanish</i>es at the end of the round only to instantly reappear on Zutha's person.  </p><p><strong>Shadowy Remnants (Su)</strong> Zutha's fragment does not have the standard lich ability of rejuvenation. When destroyed, Zutha and his shadow gear collapse into a pile of decay and ruin that, over the course of several minutes, wafts away into shadows before fading entirely from the physical world. During that time, though, any living creatures within 300 feet of the runelord feel raw necromantic power metaphysically caressing their souls. All creatures in this area of effect gain a +2 bonus on saving throws against attacks from undead creatures. This bonus persists until the creature is slain by a death effect-when this occurs, the +2 bonus is expended and the death effect that would have otherwise slain the creature is negated. A creature that becomes enhanced by these shadowy remnants instinctively understands the benefit and knows how this protection functions. Note that if the fragment's existence ends  as a result of the expiration of the runewaking ritual's 1-minute duration, he and his shadow gear disappear but nearby creatures do not gain the necromantic power.</p></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Return_of_the_Runelords.jpg","_id":"6SbtU9ACux2V02Ve"}

One foundation of the complex magical technique used to create sinspawn was known as runewarping. Through the use of runewarping, Alaznist and other powerful mages created horribly twisted creatures from their slaves and prisoners. These creators valued ability over aesthetics, so runewarped creatures were transformed  by powerful magic into horrid mockeries of their previous forms. Runewarped creatures seek out sources of magic to consume, trying in vain to complete their transformation. Although a runewarped creature is recognizable as the creature it once was, the creature bears altered or additional limb joints, elongated fingers, and a massive jaw capable of delivering a powerful bite.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p> Runewarped creatures are not tied to a particular sin. They cannot detect any specific emanations of sin, but they instead sniff out magic and magical abilities. A runewarped creature constantly searches for magical energy in hopes of completing its unfinished transformation-a futile effort due to the incomplete nature of runewarping. When a runewarped creature locates a source of magic, such as a magic item or a spellcaster, it attempts to consume it. Runewarped creatures gnaw on magical items, worrying at them until they are wholly destroyed. A runewarped creature's bite siphons away the magical abilities of creatures capable of casting spells or using spell-like abilities. If a runewarped creature kills such a creature, it often drags the body away to consume it entirely.  No matter how much it gluts itself on magic, a runewarped creature can never sate its hunger. The unstable magic resonating through the runewarped creature disrupts any consumed magic and dissipates it without any benefit to the runewarped creature.  A runewarped creature is not immortal and must still eat and drink as normal, but runewarping grants an incredibly long lifespan-a few runewarped creatures from the days of ancient Thassilon still lurk in isolated subterranean dungeons. When exposed to ongoing sources of rune magic, such as an active <i>runewell</i>, these extraordinarily old runewarped creatures sometimes transform into something more twisted and powerful, able to expend their consumed energy as spell-like abilities. Known as sinwarped (see page 87), these creatures are living embodiments of sin magic.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Although the exact means of creating runewarped creatures was lost to Earthfall, creatures still occasionally find themselves twisted by runewarping magic. Creatures exposed to aberrant energies in Alaznist's ancient laboratories, or who spend prolonged periods near residual echoes of such energies, find their flesh twisting and their minds wracked with the magical hunger that runewarping creates. Hidden chambers within Hollow Mountain have warped many unaware explorers in this way. Runewarped creatures created in this manner tend to adopt the source of their affliction as their home, exhibiting a fierce territoriality.  Runewarped creatures might work together to share resources, set traps, or plan thefts, although their constant hunger usually makes such alliances short lived. Some runewarped creatures subjugate groups of lesser creatures, such as morlocks or goblins, sending them out to kidnap spellcasters to feed their magical hunger.  <br /><strong>CREATING A RUNEWARPED CREATURE</strong><br />  \"Runewarped creature\" is an acquired template that can be added to any animal, humanoid, or monstrous humanoid (referred to hereafter as the base creature). A runewarped creature uses the base creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted here.  <br /><strong>Challenge Rating:</strong> Base creature's CR + 1.  <br /><strong>Alignment:</strong> Any evil.  <br /><strong>Type:</strong> The creature's type changes to aberration. Do not recalculate its base attack bonus, saves, or skill ranks.  <br /><strong>Senses:</strong> The creature gains darkvision with a range of 60 feet, low-light vision, and magic-scent.  <br /><i>Magic-Scent (Su)</i>: Runewarped creatures have scent that detects only creatures with the ability to cast spells. This scent allows the runewarped creature to know the location and power of all magic auras within range of its scent. Magic-scent always detects magic auras in a range of 60 feet and is not affected by wind.  <br /><strong>Armor Class:</strong> Natural armor bonus increases by 2.  <br /><strong>Hit Dice:</strong> Change all the creature's racial Hit Dice to d8s. Hit Dice derived from class levels remain unchanged.  <br /><strong>Defensive Abilities:</strong> A runewarped creature with 5 Hit Dice or more gains DR 5/magic (or DR 10/magic if it has 11 Hit Dice or more) and SR equal to its new CR + 6 (or SR equal to its new CR + 11 if it has 11 Hit Dice or more).  <br /><strong>Melee:</strong> A runewarped creature gains a bite attack that deals damage based on the runewarped creature's size but as if it were one size category larger than its actual size. If the runewarped creature already has a bite attack, the bite's damage increases by one step, as if it had increased one size category.  <br /><strong>Special Attacks:</strong> A runewarped creature loses any spells or spell-like abilities, but it retains all other special attacks and abilities of the base creature. A runewarped creature gains the following special attack.  <br /><i>Consume Magic (Su)</i>: A runewarped creature's bite drains magical ability from creatures capable of casting spells or using spell-like abilities. The struck creature loses its highest-level prepared spell, spell slot, or spell-like ability unless it succeeds at a Will save to negate the effect. A creature can be affected by this ability only once per round, even if attacked multiple times or by multiple runewarped creatures. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Ability Scores: Str +4, Con +2, Int -4 (minimum 1), Cha -2.  <br /><strong>SINWARPED CREATURES</strong><br /> Runewarped creatures subjected to prolonged direct exposure to a <i>runewell</i> or sin magic gain additional powers related to a specific sin, seeking out magic and spellcasters associated with that sin.  Sinwarped creatures are runewarped creatures with the advanced creature simple template, magic-scent with a range of 120 feet, and spell-like abilities determined by the creature's affinity to a particular school of sin magic: envy (<i>resist energy</i> and shield), gluttony (<i>chill touch</i> and <i>false</i> life), greed (<i>barkskin</i> and <i>expeditious</i> retreat), lust (<i>hold person</i> and hypnotism), pride (<i>blur</i> and <i>color</i> spray), sloth (<i>cure moderate wounds</i> and grease), or wrath (<i>burning hands</i> and darkness). Each spell-like ability is usable once per day. When a target loses a prepared spell, spell slot, or spell-like ability that is at least 3rd level to a sinwarped creature's consume magic ability, the sinwarped creature regains all of these spell-like abilities it has used.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Return_of_the_Runelords.jpg","_id":"8AqS4adbf8WYVWhj"}

This ability prevents a time flayer from being surprised, caught flat-footed, or flanked. It also grants the time flayer an insight bonus to AC equal to its Wisdom bonus. This ability can be negated, but the time flayer can restart it as a free action on its next turn.  </p><p><strong>Immunity to Temporal Magic (Ex)</strong> A time flayer is immune to all time-related spells and effects (including <i>time stop</i>, <i>temporal stasis</i>, and the like).  </p><p><strong>Reality Bend (Su)</strong> As a swift action, a time flayer can fold the dimensional space surrounding it so its true location is hard to discern. The time flayer can activate this ability after it is hit in battle to suddenly not be where it was the moment before, giving it a 50% miss chance it can apply to successful strikes after they occur (but before damage is rolled). This is similar to the miss chance granted by a <i>displacement</i> spell. <i>See invisibility</i> does not reveal the creature's location, but <i>true seeing</i> does.  </p><p><strong>Temporal Displacement (Su)</strong> As a +12 melee touch attack up to three times per day, a time flayer can attempt to send a creature a few seconds into the future. The creature touched can resist being temporally displaced with a successful DC 20 Fortitude save. On a failed save, the creature vanishes in a flash of white light, only to reappear in the same space 1d4 rounds later. If that space is occupied when the creature returns, it is shunted harmlessly aside to the closest unoccupied space. The save DC is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Time Jaunt (Su)</strong> A time flayer normally has the ability to travel through time and space, but in this encounter, the nature of the stopped time prevents the time flayer from using this power entirely.</p></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Return_of_the_Runelords.jpg","_id":"8Oq5okCjsXVhYfdy"}

The cyphergull intuitively understands how the spells function and counts as having  the requisite ability score for casting the spell.

Their appearance and behavior greatly resembles those of their mundane cousins-seagulls-but they are far more intelligent, and their connection to Riddleport's ancient Thassilonian stone arch grants them many magical abilities.  A cyphergull is a little over 2 feet long, has a wingspan of up to 5 feet, and weighs 3 pounds.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p> The records of an esoteric order known as the Cyphermages indicate that a few times in the history of Riddleport, seagulls have suddenly gathered in large numbers near the Cyphergate, forming an immense spiral of feathers and flesh before crashing into the giant stone arch. Each time, the birds die by the hundreds, but the few that survive transform into something more than mere seagulls. While they retain many physical characteristics of seagulls, they are generally more robust and intelligent than their common cousins.  Two cyphergull parents always produce cyphergull offspring, but interbreeding with ordinary gulls also occurs when suitable cyphergull mates are not available. The chicks of such mixed pairs are usually ordinary gulls, but mating occasionally results in a clutch of cyphergulls. Cyphergull eggs exude a soft blue glow and bear dark splotches that sometimes form patterns reminiscent of runes. After 3 or 4 weeks of incubation, loud, blue-eyed chicks hatch from the eggs. Over the first 4 years of a cyphergull's life, different runic patterns appear on its plumage until the creature reaches adulthood and the runes settle to a permanent pattern. Cyphergulls live up to 50 years in the wild and can live even longer in captivity.  Cyphergulls are excellent fliers, but are also able swimmers and remarkably daring. With their mobility and intelligence, cyphergulls exhibit an exceptional variety of hunting strategies. Using their unhinging jaws, they can quickly gulp down many different kinds of prey, including crabs, fish, frogs, rodents, and even smaller birds. Cyphergulls are particularly inventive creatures,  especially when it comes to finding food. For example, they sometimes use earthworms as bait to catch fish or set simple deadfall traps. When cyphergulls steal from humanoids, they often work in pairs; one of the birds creates a diversion while the other snatches the prize.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Versatile feeders, cyphergulls prefer coastal areas and islands, where they can hunt on land, on water, and in the air. The largest cyphergull populations exist in and around Riddleport, particularly on the slopes of the rocky ridges that surround the city and on the rooftops of the Wharf District and the Windward District. Several smaller populations of cyphergulls exist along the shores of the Varisian Gulf, most frequently near human settlements. In Magnimar, a careful observer may notice that some of the birds circling above the Irespan are in fact blue-eyed cyphergulls. Cyphergulls winter in southwestern Cheliax and along Rahadoum's northern coast.  In late spring, cyphergulls assemble into noisy, densely packed colonies, usually returning to the same spot as the previous year. The breeding season begins a few weeks later when warm summer breezes start coming in from the Varisian Gulf. The birds build their nests on the ground, using leaves, twigs, and other plant matter as building materials. Cyphergulls are almost irrationally fond of paper and parchment, and they sometimes go to great lengths to obtain scrolls and books to use as nest-building materials.  Cyphergull colonies have rigid hierarchies, where mated pairs of lower standing build their nests to form a ring around the nests of higher-ranking cyphergulls, protecting them against attacks. Cyphergulls mate for life and are very protective of their nests and the colony; if a predator isn't deterred by the gulls' warning calls, the birds cooperatively attack and harass the intruder, using their numbers against bigger creatures. The birds employ surprisingly elaborate defensive tactics, such as feint attacks and false retreats to lead enemies into ambushes.  While food finding and nest building are the birds' first priorities during the breeding season, cyphergulls exhibit a range of personalities comparable to that of humans whenever survival is not at stake. For example, some are tricksters or collectors who like to annoy others or steal items just to stave off boredom, and most have favorite foods that they seek out. A surprisingly large number of cyphergulls, and nearly always the highest-ranked gulls in a colony, are philosophers who study the world around them, perform simple experiments, and understand the rudiments of logic and the scientific method. Some cyphergulls practice something akin to religious rituals, placing food and other objects on the ground to form  runes and remaining motionless above them for hours at a time. Scholars speculate that the birds have a unique ability to interpret the secrets of the Cyphergate, and that studying the birds' runic writing could reveal ancient knowledge. Cyphermages in particular study cyphergulls in the wild, but clinging to guano-spattered rocks and rooftops to look at birds doesn't improve their reputation as obsessive eccentrics.  Cyphergulls are curious about humanoids, often observing how they speak, what they eat, and how they live. A common superstition among the peoples of the Varisian Gulf states that killing a cyphergull brings bad luck, so the birds get away with thefts or irritations that would doom other birds. Cyphergulls are intelligent enough to learn languages that humanoid creatures speak, but they lack any speech-producing organs. Their communication sounds like the harsh wailing calls of ordinary gulls, but their system of shrieks is far more complex, and they are capable of communicating even abstract ideas like \"ambush,\" \"deal,\" \"future,\" or \"payment\" with their calls. This allows them to devise elaborate defensive and offensive tactics, or to negotiate trade deals.  A 7th-level spellcaster with the Improved Familiar feat and an alignment within one step of neutral can gain a cyphergull as a familiar.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Return_of_the_Runelords.jpg","_id":"BvL1jiAWkPE0l3RK"}

He then lands and attacks in melee. Once reduced to 125 hp or fewer, he casts <i>invisibility</i> to retreat, takes to the sky, and begins using his ranged spells mixed with breath weapon attacks. If at any point it appears that Ninuron is about to destroy the party entirely, the dragon relents and offers the PCs a chance to submit to his demands. In this case, he doesn't ask for the PCs' aid in exploring the Therassic  Library-he expects it from those he has bested in combat. Even at his angriest, the dragon doesn't want to slaughter the PCs, as he hopes they can help him. He avoids using his breath weapon against foes that are likely to immediately perish, nor does he attack foes who look like they might be on their last legs. Judge the fight as appropriate, and be ready for Ninuron to offer mercy instead of killing a PC if the time comes.</p><p><strong>Morale </strong>Ninuron fights until he is reduced to fewer than 75 hit points, at which point he calls for a truce, offering each PC a choice of treasure from his hoard (see page 6) if they let him live and assist him.</p></div><hr /><div><p><strong>STATISTICS</strong></p></div><hr /><div><p><strong>Str </strong>28, <strong>Dex </strong>13, <strong>Con </strong>22, <strong>Int </strong> 17, <strong>Wis </strong>16, <strong>Cha </strong>17</p><p><strong>Base Atk </strong>+17; <strong>CMB </strong>+28; <strong>CMD </strong>39 (43 vs. trip)</p><p><strong>Feats </strong>Cleave, Great Cleave, Improved Critical (claw), Improved Initiative, Multiattack, Power Attack, Skill Focus (Knowledge [history]), Weapon Focus (bite, claw)</p><p><strong>Skills </strong>Diplomacy +23, Fly +13, Knowledge (arcana) +23, Knowledge (geography) +23, Knowledge (history) +29, Knowledge (planes) +23, Knowledge (religion) +23, Perception +23, Spellcraft +23</p><p><strong>Languages </strong>Aklo, Common, Draconic, Sylvan</p><p><strong>SQ </strong>exiled, immortal, no breath, read the threads, starflight</p></div><hr /><div><p><strong>SPECIAL ABILITIES</strong></p></div><hr /><div><p><strong>Exiled (Ex)</strong> Ninuron has been exiled from the Dimension of Time. He cannot enter that dimension again, nor can he enter areas particularly infused with the dimension's energies (such as the Therassic Library below Jorgenfist). As long as his exile continues, he remains immortal and does not age-something others might consider a boon, but to a dragon, who grows more powerful only with age, it has been agony. In this adventure, nothing can remove this effect from the time dragon, but depending on the PCs' actions in the last adventure of Return of the Runelords, they might be able to release Ninuron from his strange fate.</p></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Return_of_the_Runelords.jpg","_id":"Drf22baUI8ndNr56"}

A kasthezvi can remain in an <i>alter</i>nate form for up to 8 hours each day.  </p><p><strong>Death Throes (Su)</strong> When killed, a kasthezvi explodes in a 100-foot-radius burst of long-suppressed sound. This burst deals 16d6 points of sonic damage and permanently deafens creatures in the area. Affected creatures can attempt a DC 21 Fortitude save to reduce the damage by half and negate the deafness. This is a sonic effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Soundless (Ex)</strong> A kasthezvi never causes sound through its actions, whether mundane or magical, except when it uses its word of sundering ability. This includes its movement,  abilities, contact with other creatures or objects, attempts at vocalization, spell effects, and any other possible sources of sound. This does not prevent sounds made by the victims of its attacks. A kasthezvi that can cast spells does so as if its spells were modified by the Silent Spell feat, but without increasing the spell's level or casting time.  </p><p><strong>Subsonic Touch (Su)</strong> A kasthezvi's touch is a touch attack that deals 1d8 points of damage that bypasses damage reduction, plus 12d6 sonic damage. Though this additional damage is sonic damage, it makes no audible noise.  </p><p><strong>Word of Sundering (Su)</strong> Once per minute, a kasthezvi can speak a silent word of sundering; this takes 1 full round. When it finishes speaking the word at the beginning of its next turn, the kasthezvi targets a 40-foot-radius spread within 800 feet. This area is targeted by an <i>earthquake</i> spell. In addition, creatures in the area take 8d6 points of sonic damage (Fortitude DC 21 half) and unattended nonmagical objects of ceramic, crystal, glass, or porcelain in the area silently break into dozens of pieces, as if affected by a <i>shatter</i> spell. The kasthezvi's caster level for these effects is equal to its racial Hit Dice (CL 16th for most kasthezvis). If the kasthezvi is killed, stunned, or otherwise prevented from vocalizing while uttering its word of sundering, the word ends with no effect. If a kasthezvi speaks a word of sundering while it has changed its shape, it immediately reverts to its true form. This is a sonic effect, though it is not blocked by spells or effects that create silence. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Malicious and immortal, kasthezvis are among the most ancient creatures inhabiting the deep places beneath Kaer Maga. Their long-dead creators crafted these abominations to be utterly incapable of causing sound, as their very bones are vessels for primal words of power.  If a kasthezvi could fully speak the primordial words etched into its bones, it could cause catastrophic devastation with a simple phrase. However, kasthezvis' creators intended kasthezvis to contain and conceal the words, not use them, and etched primordial silence onto the kasthezvis' souls. This suppressive magic has slowly deteriorated with each passing century, and as it has, kasthezvis have drawn strength from the ancient words contained within. They are now capable of issuing powerful, silent utterances that can level entire buildings. Given time, there is no telling the extent of their power.  A kasthezvi's body is roughly humanoid in shape, though otherwise alien in appearance. Its dry, cracked skin stretches across misshapen bones. Its skull is typically at an unnatural angle to its body, and its silently screaming face is asymmetrical. A crown of bone floats above its head, vibrating erratically. A kasthezvi's every movement appears deceptively lurching and uncoordinated.  A kasthezvi is 6 feet tall but weighs only 100 pounds.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p> The origin of the kasthezvis, whose existence is unknown to virtually everyone except the enigmatic caulborn (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 3</i> 48) beneath Kaer Maga, is long forgotten. Some caulborn speculate that the kasthezvis are living weapons, while others claim that the creatures were originally benign, and that the death of their masters caused them untold suffering, corrupting their true purpose. Most caulborn agree that the kasthezvis' bone crowns act as magical dampeners and allow the kasthezvis to speak powerful words without imploding, but no one has ever managed to acquire an intact crown for study.  As the creations of ancient beings, kasthezvis cannot procreate. They frequently band together in small cabals and rarely feud with one another. Learning the process to create more kasthezvis may be their greatest desire, beyond harnessing the primordial power they contain.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Kasthezvis have complete contempt for all living things and show only the barest respect for those more powerful than themselves. Yet theirs is a patient, meticulous evil. Kasthezvis are extremely cautious when speaking words of sundering or making their clandestine trips to spy on the surface world, knowing that their power is greater if no one knows they exist. When kasthezvi visit the city above, they disguise themselves as mute beggars or pious, quiet Sweettalkers. Few notice that they make no sound, and those who discover these spies' unnatural silence typically vanish in fatal \"accidents\" beneath the city. The purpose of kasthezvis' espionage is unknown. Some caulborn speculate that the kasthezvis are preparing to collapse the entire city in a single, silent cataclysm; others believe they seek to refine the ancient words that give them power or to discover a process by which they can procreate among the fecund surface dwellers.  Kaladurnae, Thassilon's first Runelord of Greed, had a tenuous arrangement with the kasthezvis. In exchange for knowledge of the ancient city and snippets of powerful words and phrases, Runelord Kaladurnae trained a select few kasthezvis in wizardry. These powerful runespeakers still live, but are cursed with greed. They hoard their arcane knowledge and venture from their lairs only when enticed by the prospect of learning new secrets. Kaladurnae also taught the kasthezvis to write. Kasthezvis cover their austere lairs with runes, scratches, and ancient Thassilonian letters, occasionally mixed with silent <i>explosive runes</i> inscribed by their runespeakers. These writings would be the greatest source of knowledge  about the kasthezvis' history, culture, and motivations-if anyone could locate and decipher them. Aside from these writings, Kasthezvis communicate using a unique sign language known only to their kind, in which they use their entire bodies in an inhuman display of contortions and jerking limbs.  All kasthezvi can speak words of terrible, sundering power, but some caulborn claim to have witnessed kasthezvi speak other words with different destructive effects: storms of hail and fire, endless swarms of insects, and the reversal of gravity or even time.  Frustrated by their inability to understand kasthezvis, some caulborn hire adventuring scholars to try to infiltrate and study kasthezvi lairs. No such mission has yet succeeded.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Return_of_the_Runelords.jpg","_id":"GliYKybf9S77k9Jh"}

Thus, the nochlean could sniff out a child's hiding place or a den of wolf pups, but it could not sniff out the child's parents or the den mother.  </p><p><strong>Music Susceptibility (Su)</strong> A nochlean is sensitive to music of all kinds, and different styles of music affect the nochlean in different ways. A creature within 20 feet of a nochlean can attempt to affect the creature with a Perform (keyboard, percussion, sing, string, or wind) check made as a standard action or when used to initiate another effect, such as a bardic performance. The nochlean must succeed at a Will saving throw with a DC equal to the result of the Perform check or become affected by the music for as long as the music persists. The nochlean is sickened by keyboard  instruments, shaken by percussion instruments, en<i>rage</i>d (per the <i>rage</i> spell) by singing, staggered by string instruments, and confused by wind instruments. The nochlean can be affected by only one type of music at a time; if it fails its saving throw against multiple types of music, only that with the highest Perform check result applies.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Predatory fey that delight in vandalizing homes, murdering pets, and stealing children, nochleans resemble incredibly thin, gangly humanoids with coarse black hair, large yellow eyes, and wickedly sharp claws. Their most recognizable features, however, are their extraordinary large ears. A nochlean's earlobes are several feet long, and it usually keeps them wrapped around its neck like a scarf or draped over its hands to conceal its claws from casual notice.  Nochleans enjoy their wicked activities, frequently tittering from the shadows as they plan to raid a home, murder livestock, or lure away a lonely child. Nochleans are bold and crafty schemers who attack only when they feel like they have the advantage. A nochlean's careful plans evaporate in the presence of music, however, as the notes echoing around in their large ears affect them in erratic ways. Most nochleans flee from any source of music, and many tales tell of lone travelers unknowingly repelling the lurking creatures with casual whistling.  A nochlean stands 5-1/2 feet tall and weighs 50 pounds.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p> Nochleans have lived at the edges of humanoid societies for millennia, their predations serving as a warning to children of all races and creeds to stay with their protectors and be wary of strangers. Nochleans are aware that humanoids use tales of their presence to frighten others, and they revel in the role thrust upon them and the depth of fear it can instill.  Nochleans are gaunt and eerily slinky, as though perfectly built to hug shadowed corners, slither through windows, or extend a gangly arm from under a bed. They rely on stealth, suspense, and their alien appearance to frighten foes, as their build is narrow and hardly imposing. Still, to a child, nochleans stand frightfully tall. Nochleans usually wear simple clothes stolen from humans, but they generally have little use for propriety or modesty. Their long ears twitch frequently, particularly in response to sudden noises. When tracking by scent, a nochlean bends low to the ground, its dragging ears funneling odors toward its sniffing nose. A nochlean's claws are long and sharp, although its hands have a supernaturally narrow appearance. Their claws are remarkably agile despite their size, and nochleans use them to pry up windows, undo locks, or curl delicately around sleeping infants.  Every few centuries, a nochlean develops a large cyst on its back, forcing it to give up its hunting for about a week as it sits hunched and uncommonly ponderous. The cyst grows quickly, soon becoming nearly as large as the nochlean itself. After a week, the cyst ruptures, and a fully formed duplicate of the \"parent\" nochlean emerges. This new nochlean understands how to hunt and how to speak Sylvan, although it picks up other languages it hears (usually, languages spoken in nearby humanoid communities) very quickly. The older nochlean typically drives the duplicate out of its hunting grounds to cut down competition, as nochleans are unwilling to work together even if they are copies of one other.  Nochleans make their homes in small, rotten groves, which they fill with decaying plant matter, strung-up animal carcasses, and bedding that consists of soft but putrefying materials. A nochlean desires little else by way of physical comforts and eats very little. A nochlean might stay away from its lair for days at a time as it stalks a nearby settlement, returning to its putrefying bed to consume a rotting animal carcass and <i>sleep</i> for a few scant hours before leaving again. Although nochleans are unquestionably evil, many forest guardians who simply wish to see the forest thrive rarely trouble a nochlean or its lair. Despite their putrescent beds, nochleans subsist on decay; as they amass rotted vegetation and animal remains, they do actually beautify and aid the forest as a whole.  Nochleans have an exceptionally long lifespan, although measuring a single nochlean's age is difficult when younger and nearly identical duplicates inhabit nearby lairs and might overlap in hunting areas. Most nochleans die at the hands of angry parents or forest guardians before reaching old age, but a nochlean surviving more than 500 years finds its black claws slowly whitening- the only indication of its advanced age.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Nochleans can be found in any lush forest with plenty of undergrowth, particularly where humanoid settlements are near. Several nochleans live around the gnome community of Whistledown, although the cacophony of wind chimes placed on eaves and posts in that town usually keeps the nochleans at bay. To many in Whistledown, tales of big-eared child snatchers are  mere fancy, as they don't realize how much their custom of hanging chimes to ward away \"evil spirits\" legitimately protects them from these evil fey.  Nochleans lead solitary lives, aware that too many of their kind hunting in the same area would draw undue attention. Nochleans know they are safest when they are unnoticed by anyone other than their targets, and when frustrated farmers or grieving parents don't know whether to blame accident or malice for mysterious disappearances. No nochlean has a proper name; instead, each of them answers to the name \"Nochlean,\" although a few revel in epithets such as \"Snatcher\" or \"Shadowman\" bestowed upon them by frightened settlements where they hunt.  Nochleans rely on subterfuge and a carefully studied knowledge of terrain to run or hide from confrontations, and some nochleans know the shadowed corners and overlooked hiding places around a settlement much better than the settlement's inhabitants do. Nochleans rarely enter a fight unless they feel they have the upper hand. In any confrontation, nochleans are notoriously difficult to pin down; they dart around attackers rather than stay put and, if pressed, teleport away from attackers that corner them. An endangered nochlean thinks nothing of abandoning its home or a fruitful hunting ground to find another, and the most fortunate hunters might find a kidnapped child trussed up but alive inside a lair a nochlean elected to abandon out of self-preservation.  When they need to interact with humans in ways other than terrorizing or attacking them, nochleans prefer to disguise their distinctive appearance. They pull their common caps low, wrapping their distinctive ears around them like a scarf or a cloak, and remain in shadow to conceal their facial features. Certain unsavory traders strike deals with nochleans, as the fey monsters are skilled at procuring children useful for ransom, slavery, or darker purposes. Although nochleans like magic items that can aid them in their dark endeavors, they prefer to trade in favors, which they greedily hoard. A nochlean finds the mere presence of a musical instrument to be an unforgiveable offense, and a prospective negotiator might provoke a nochlean into a blind fury simply by failing to conceal a flute or fiddle.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Return_of_the_Runelords.jpg","_id":"H9bqJLzvQenSeoOu"}

An ashullian always has line of effect to any area of its bower, and can cause any of its spell-like or supernatural abilities to originate from any point within its bower instead of from  its own space. While inside its bower, the ashullian can use its <i>telekinesis</i> and <i>major creation</i> spell-like abilities at will to affect any creatures and objects located within. The ashullian's bower remains in place until the ashullian dies, moves more than 200 feet from the bower, or creates a new bower. A <i>dispel magic</i> spell or effect cannot dispel an ashullian's bower, although it can suppress the bower as though it were a magic item.  </p><p><strong>Powerful Tentacles (Ex)</strong> An ashullian treats its tentacle attacks as primary natural attacks.  </p><p><strong>Synesthetic Masterpiece (Su)</strong> Once every 1d4 rounds, an ashullian can briefly channel its artistic mastery to flood its bower with an overwhelming multisensory experience. Non-ashullians within its bower must each succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude saving throw or take 5d8 points of sonic damage and be staggered for 1 round, and must also succeed at a DC 20 Will save or take 5d8 points of damage and be fascinated for 1 round (during this round, the creature does not view anything within the bower that does not attack the affected creature as a potential threat). A creature that fails both saving throws is stunned for 1d4 rounds, rather than staggered or fascinated for 1 round. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Blind, contemplative artists from the lightless depths of the Elemental Plane of Water, ashullians coaxed sounds, tastes, and other diverse stimuli into miles-wide galleries among the plane's freezing currents. A powerful race of subterranean humanoids beneath Kaer Maga coveted the ashullians' abilities and tore open a planar rift that captured several ashullians but also flooded the humanoids' underground chambers with icy water. The humanoids vanished, and their ashullian prisoners now haunt the Kaer Magan caves known as the Drowned Levels. For generations, these creatures have prowled the chambers of their vanished captors. Ashullians seek objects that realize their eclectic and unpredictable aesthetic sense and showcase whatever oddities they find-which could include anything from a sodden scroll or a jeweled brooch to a severed foot-by wearing them in their flesh or displaying them in their magical bowers.  Ashullians are not inherently aggressive, but they demand that strangers contribute curios for their art. An ashullian's sense of a \"curio\" is utterly alien to most creatures, and can range from a bauble or scarf to a moist lump of bread or a long strip of newly flayed skin. Denying an ashullian is likely to provoke its rage.  A typical ashullian's lithe form measures 16 feet from head to tails and weighs only 200 pounds.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p> An ashullian's eyeless, eellike head has a small, lipless mouth full of unsettling humanlike teeth. Its elongated  cranium sits above a supple neck and four sharp-tipped tentacles. Its torso splits into two thick tails as long as the rest of its body. An ashullian's transparent, leathery skin reveals a body cavity with swirling iridescent ribbons of fluid in place of organs. Ciliated clefts and soft, flexible spines-the ashullian's sensory apparatuses-run along its back and arms.  Although their ancestors lived in the Plane of Water, the ashullians beneath Kaer Maga are now native outsiders. Their artistic abilities are stunted, degenerate versions of those of their progenitors, who may still swim within enormous sensory galleries in the Elemental Plane of Water. Ashullians on Golarion can realize their grand visions only within their bowers, exercising incredible control in pursuit of their inscrutable artistry. Within a bower, the diverse contents' own sensory elements- such as the coarse texture of rusted mail, the sour taste of reagents, and the stink of decaying flesh-are combined with whorls of scent, sounds, and other minor manifestations injected by the ashullian. An ashullian can create and move objects within its bower by thought alone, and can even suspend basic physical laws there; if an ashullian chooses, an object remains eternally suspended in the water in defiance of gravity, or remains dry despite being submerged. An ashullian revels in the synesthetic glory of its bower, but other creatures find the multisensory experience overwhelming.  The ancient magic that brought ashullians to the Drowned Levels keeps most of them trapped there. A few, though, have escaped their prison via purloined magic, while others have simply vanished without a trace. Ashullians whisper that these paragons transcended their existence through ultimate artistic mastery and seek to follow these mythical examples.  Ashullians are spawned singly and mature on their own. Ashullians grow slowly and can reach 300 years old. The bodies of deceased ashullians are almost always incorporated into the bowers of younger ashullians as an artistic statement about aging or the transience of life.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  When not tending to their individual bowers, ashullians search the Drowned Levels for inspiration and clues to a means of escape. Ashullians are not the only occupants of these dismal, sodden halls; water elementals and other aquatic creatures swim through the ashullians' domain. Ashullians are generally content to let familiar creatures pass, although they have an intense fixation on visitors from the surface. These visitors are first pestered for trinkets and curios, but eventually restrained and stripped layer by layer so the ashullian can experience  their full sensory measure. Occasionally, visitors escape an ashullian's attention by presenting a novel artistic display and fleeing while the creature is occupied. Ashullians are rarely welcome within another ashullian's bower, as each considers its own artistic experiments to be superior to those of its kin and is unabashedly critical of others.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Return_of_the_Runelords.jpg","_id":"HJLxJNpUbfRn1BQd"}

If reduced to fewer than 100 hit points, she realizes the PCs are formidable foes and she calls for a truce, using compliments and appeals to their prowess in an attempt to secure a momentary respite from battle before using <i>dimension door</i> to relocate to a place of safety that still  allows communication. If the PCs continue to press the attack, she uses <i>dimension door</i> again, this time to retreat up into the upper floors of the palace to recover and report the situation to Inkariax. It takes her 2d4 days to convince the White Death that the PCs are worth dealing with, and if the PCs are still in Frozen Tears at this point, they are confronted by the kyton demagogue himself-see page 86 for his statistics and page 13 of the adventure for advice on how to handle this perilous situation. If the PCs agree to speak with Lyraesia, she thanks them for their wisdom and asks them what their purpose is in Frozen Tears. If she learns they seek only to use White Death's Diadem as a staging ground for a ritual to enter Belimarius's realm, she is intrigued. She won't agree to give the PCs her pendant, but she does volunteer to aid them in attacking Lady Wollnoxe to secure the troll's pendant instead. In return for the PCs honoring their truce with her, she allows them entrance into White Death's Diadem to travel to Xin- Edasseril. She warns them that the terms of the truce are over once they do so, and if they ever return to Frozen Tears, they will be met with a deadly reception from Inkariax himself. She allows the PCs to keep the <i>pendant of the first tears</i> they take from Lady Wollnoxe, in any event.</p></div><hr /><div><p><strong>STATISTICS</strong></p></div><hr /><div><p><strong>Str </strong>27, <strong>Dex </strong>25, <strong>Con </strong>20, <strong>Int </strong> 17, <strong>Wis </strong>24, <strong>Cha </strong>21</p><p><strong>Base Atk </strong>+20; <strong>CMB </strong>+30 (+32 disarm); <strong>CMD </strong>53 (55 vs. disarm)</p><p><strong>Feats </strong>Alertness, Blinding Critical, Combat Expertise, Combat Reflexes, Critical Focus, Deadly Aim, Gorgon's Fist, Improved Critical (sai), Improved Disarm, Improved Initiative, Improved Unarmed Strike, Point-Blank Shot, Precise Shot, Scorpion Style, Stunning Fist</p><p><strong>Skills </strong>Acrobatics +30, Bluff +28, Intimidate +28, Knowledge (local) +22, Knowledge (planes) +22, Knowledge (religion) +26, Perception +34, Sense Motive +32, Stealth +30, Survival +26</p><p><strong>Languages </strong>Common, Infernal, Shadowtongue</p><p><strong>SQ </strong>fast movement, high jump, ki pool (10 points, magic), maneuver training, slow fall 30 ft.</p><p><strong>Combat Gear </strong><i>boots of speed</i>; <strong>Other Gear </strong><i>+2 icy burst adamantine sai</i>, <i>cloak of resistance +3</i>, <i>pendant of the first tears</i></p></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Return_of_the_Runelords.jpg","_id":"KIKGMqEl3aSUVzOP"}

Any creature that starts its turn in this cloud is sickened for 1 round (Fortitude DC 30 negates). The cloud obscures all sight beyond 5 feet, providing total concealment. A creature within 5 feet has concealment. The save DC is Constitution-based.  </p><p><strong>Fire Aura (Su)</strong> An ashen forgemaster is surrounded by an aura of intense heat. All creatures within 5 feet take 1d6 points of fire damage at the beginning of the forgemaster's turn.  </p><p><strong>Lava Trail (Su)</strong> At the start of the forgemaster's turn, any square it occupies melts or catches fire from the intense heat of its body. These squares become difficult terrain for all creatures other than the ashen forgemaster. Each creature that enters or begins its turn within the affected squares takes 10d6 points of fire damage. The squares cool and return to normal after 1 round.  </p><p><strong>Prison Forge (Su)</strong> An ashen forgemaster is bound to a monolithic forge and cannot stray more than 500 feet from it. A forgemaster that moves more than 500 feet from its prison forge is staggered until it returns. A forgemaster that remains more than 500 feet from its forge for 24 hours takes 2d6 points of Charisma damage, and an additional 2d6 points of Charisma damage every day it remains out of range of its forge. When the total Charisma damage equals or exceeds the forgemaster's Charisma score, it is destroyed and rejuvenated in its prison forge once again (see below).  </p><p><strong>Rejuvenation (Su)</strong> One day after an ashen forgemaster is destroyed, its forge begins to rebuild the undead creature's body. This process takes 2d6 days-if the body is destroyed before that time passes, the forge merely starts the process anew. After this time passes, the forgemaster awakens fully healed. It does not have any of the gear left behind on its old body, but it can forge a new weapon or simply select one from the many weapons it has previously made.  </p><p><strong>Smoke Vision (Ex)</strong> An ashen forgemaster can see perfectly in smoky conditions (such as those created by <i>pyrotechnics</i> or its own ashen cloud ability).</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Ashen forgemasters are massive, undead salamanders tasked with eternally toiling at a forge, crafting armor and weapons. They begin their lives as living salamanders but are bound to a forge, continuing their work eternally, long into their undeath. Centuries spent in seclusion erodes their personality, and they eventually grow into paranoid, violent, and sadistic creatures. Forgemasters surround themselves with the weapons and armor they have crafted over the years, the designs and shapes of which grow more bizarre as the forgemaster's delusions grow.  An ashen forgemaster stands between 9 and 12 feet tall and weighs about 5,000 pounds.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p> Throughout history, those with the power to control salamanders have used them for their metalworking prowess. Such powerful beings sometimes bind a salamander to a forge to keep it in servitude. These salamanders might be imprisoned for decades, tasked with performing whatever their captors require of them. An ashen forgemaster is created when a salamander dies while bound to a forge. These salamanders are reborn as undead, forced by the binding spells to continue their work.  Early in their unlife, ashen forgemasters retain the appearance of flames, as a live salamander might have. As it continues to exist, however, an ashen forgemaster's flesh gradually dulls to gray and then white, until it looks like a statue of its former self. Despite their burnt-up exteriors, ashen forgemasters smolder with all the heat of the Plane of Fire. As their bodies decay and crumble away into dust, they periodically collect the remains, mix them with molten metal, rebuild themselves, and continue their eternal work.  The forge used to bind a salamander is generally covered in ritual runes that strengthen the binding and protect the forge from harm, preventing the salamander from destroying its prison to escape. A single forge cannot host more than one salamander in this way, though some spellcasters will link multiple forges at once to enslave many salamanders simultaneously.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Most forgemasters rarely see other creatures after their transformation, as they interact with only their captors. Spellcasters willing to bind a salamander to eternally work its forge seldom care about the salamander's well-being and see the creature as a mere tool to be used when necessary, ignoring it for years at a time.  A forgemaster's weakened mental state makes interaction with it dangerous. A forgemaster lashes out against those it sees as interfering with its work or attempting to steal its creations. In cases where a forgemaster is not abandoned, or when its task can actually be completed, it might retain its sense of self. These forgemasters are fiercely driven to accomplish whatever is necessary for their release, even making deals with their hated efreet enemies. Multiple salamanders bound to nearby forges often form close bonds with each other.

It can use Whirlwind Attack on this first round of combat as a standard action, making one melee attack at its highest base attack bonus against each opponent within reach.  </p><p><strong>Miserable Source (Ex)</strong> A misery siktempora created by a creature that has damaged the time stream is no more powerful than others of its kind, but its creator takes  a -4 penalty on saving throws against that particular siktempora's misery and telepathic wail abilities.  </p><p><strong>Misery (Sp)</strong> Those struck by a misery siktempora's claws are infused with the misery and despair the creature is made of. A creature that takes damage from a misery siktempora's claw must succeed at a DC 22 Will save or it becomes struck with despair and takes a -4 penalty on attack rolls, Will saving throws, and skill checks for 1 minute. If a creature is already affected by misery, failing an additional save resets the duration and restores 5 hit points to the misery siktempora. This is a mind-affecting emotion effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Savage the Suffering (Su)</strong> A misery siktempora has a supernatural knack for striking those suffering from misery and confusion. It treats confused foes and those affected by its misery attack as flat-footed.  </p><p><strong>Telepathic Wail (Su)</strong> Once per round as a swift action, a misery siktempora can fill the mind of a single living creature within 100 feet with the perception of a wail filled with horror and despair. A creature subjected to this telepathic wail must succeed at a DC 22 Will save or become confused for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Temporal Jaunt (Sp)</strong> As a standard action, a misery siktempora can <i>vanish</i> into the time stream, reappearing in another location. This ability functions as <i>dimension door</i> (so a typical misery siktempora can jaunt up to 880 feet), but the siktempora can take other actions that round after reappearing, and the destination must be in a location the siktempora could reach normally by walking. Temporal jaunts are not true teleportation-the misery siktempora simply travels to a later point in the time stream-so the ability can be used in areas that bar teleportation effects; however, in such areas a siktempora can travel only a distance equal to its speed.  </p><p><strong>Temporal Sense (Ex)</strong> A misery siktempora can sense all the possible futures of the coming seconds. This grants it an insight bonus on its Initiative checks and to its Armor Class equal to its Wisdom bonus (+5 for most misery siktemporas). A misery siktempora born from someone who damaged the time stream can use <i>discern location</i> at will as a spell-like ability to pinpoint its progenitor's location.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>All emotion goes somewhere; that energy does not simply <i>vanish</i>, sent into the void to be lost. Feelings lurch between places and congeal in the endless corners of time. The things they birth have many names, but are collectively known as siktemporas. Most siktemporas never leave the Dimension of Time, dwelling forever in their own isolated mindscape-like fugues, where they bask in the emotions that created them. Yet among the siktemporas, one variety has a penchant for traveling beyond the eerie borders of its home dimension-those born of misery.  Misery siktemporas are personifications of silent suffering. Hideous to behold, wracked in such constant pain that they can endure any agony, and with alien minds incapable of forming any other thought apart from various forms of self-loathing and despair, misery siktemporas find themselves drawn out of the Dimension of Time to seek out those who spawned them and inflict miserable vengeance.  A misery siktempora vaguely resembles a slender human with a body wrapped in black rags and scarfs. It has no arms, and its six exceptionally long spiderlike legs each end in a nearly skeletal looking claw. It has only empty black eye sockets in its narrow faces-no mouth, ears, or nose-and from those empty sockets trail constant rivers of black tears.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p> Just as physical evidence of rot and decay can remain, staining the landscape, after a creature rises from death as undead, so to can its thoughts and emotions. These mental energies, not bound by physicality, can instead stain the time of death.  Siktemporas can form in another way as well-when a mortal creature interferes with the flow of time, either by traveling back in time to create paradoxes or manipulate past events, or by attempting to move forward in time to eras yet unknown, the creature's passage can stain time with the full breadth of its emotional history. This causes the source creature no harm, but can result in the formation of dozens of siktemporas elsewhere on the Dimension of Time.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  On the Demiplane of Time, when enough of these \"emotional stains\" accumulate at one point in space and time, a siktempora can form. Those born of misery are the most common, for not only do misery and death often travel hand in hand, but alone among the siktemporas, miseries enjoy exiting their home dimension to travel the Material Plane. They have no intrinsic way of returning to the dimension of time, so for them this journey is one-way, but once they arrive, they seek only to spread their own misery.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Return_of_the_Runelords.jpg","_id":"P4BuePiZUbnyMcCJ"}

A creature within 30 feet of a warpglass ooze must succeed at a DC 13 Will save at the beginning of its turn or be compelled to move toward the ooze and take no other actions for 1 round, avoiding any other dangers along its path (including any movement that would provoke attacks of opportunity). A creature can avoid the need to make the saving throw by not looking at the warpglass ooze, as with a gaze attack. If an affected creature ends its turn adjacent to the ooze, it touches the ooze and takes a -1 penalty on all Wisdom- and Charisma-based checks from the harrowing images it sees. This penalty stacks, up to a  total of -4. The penalty is a curse effect that slowly fades with time, reducing the penalty by 1 every 24 hours until it reaches 0. A creature that successfully saves against this effect can't be affected again by the same warpglass ooze's compelling reflection for 24 hours. Sightless creatures can't be affected by this ability, nor can creatures that cast no reflection (such as vampires). This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>A menace featured in Varisian folk tales, warpglass oozes lurk in marshes and forests, masquerading as a simple puddle or stretching across the surface of a larger body of water. Tales say that a traveler can indeed see her future in the reflections of a warpglass ooze... if she can survive the creature's enchanting magic and acidic caress. In fact, creatures that look upon these ambush predators do see a warped reflection of themselves-possibly dressed as a regal knight, weeping over an open grave, or holding aloft a valuable bauble-though there is no evidence the images are founded in reality.  Warpglass oozes aren't particularly intelligent, but they are patient, favoring subtlety over brute combat. The oozes enthrall their prey with fanciful images, compelling their victims to touch its acidic surface so the ooze can break down and digest the victim's flesh. A warpglass ooze's images might be whimsical or terrifying, but they always feature the viewing creature reflected in the ooze's surface. Creatures that shake off the ooze's compulsion find their minds lingering on the distorted reflections as they attempt to meet-or avoid-the fate they witnessed. If attacked, warpglass oozes extrude knots of protoplasm to bludgeon foes, but they often retreat in the face of powerful opposition. Warpglass oozes typically don't pursue escaping prey as long as other food sources remain available, but if hungry enough, an ooze may follow a solitary creature.  A typical warpglass ooze is about 4 feet in diameter and a few inches thick, and it weighs about 250 pounds.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p> Barely sentient, warpglass oozes primarily concern themselves with the basics of survival. A warpglass ooze seeks out a spot where it can hide in plain sight, but with sufficient traffic to keep them sated. Warpglass oozes can subsist on nearly any sort of organic material, but they strongly prefer fresh meat to vegetation or carrion. As their preferred prey are animals and humanoids, both of whom are affected by their compelling reflection, warpglass oozes are usually found in well-used watering holes, ditches alongside well-traveled trails, and ponds near busy settlements. They generally avoid lairs near swift-moving water, as they aren't skilled swimmers and can mimic only still water. Warpglass oozes remain in  their selected location as long as food remains plentiful, moving on only if prey becomes scarce or if they are harassed or threatened.  Warpglass oozes reproduce asexually, splitting into two separate oozes after gaining sufficient mass through feeding (an ooze preparing to split might have the giant creature simple template). A pool of several warpglass oozes may form in particularly favorable areas where enough food allows them to frequently split.  Sages disagree on the origins of these strange oozes. Varisians circulate an old parable of a young fortune-teller who fell victim to her own vanity. Unwaveringly certain of her abilities, she left her caravan to commune with nature spirits, ignoring repeated warning omens from Desna. When the fortune teller drowned in a flash flood, her essence mingled with the water to form the first warpglass ooze. Other folk tales posit that warpglass oozes are innocent victims of cruel fey creatures such as bog nixies (<i>Pathfinder RPG <i>Bestiary 3</i></i> 201) or rusalkas (<i>Bestiary 3</i> 232) that murder charmed mortals by forcing them to stare at their own distorted image in a puddle until thirst or the elements take their inevitable toll. Academics point out that warpglass oozes are virtually unknown outside of Varisia and that Varisia's ancient history is filled with powerful wizards who mastered potent enchantments and fleshwarping magic. These scholars disagree as to whether these wizards created warpglass oozes as a weapon, as a punishment, or merely for callous amusement. Some attribute their creation specifically to Xanderghul, the runelord of pride, as every ooze's reflection is fundamentally self-centered.  Most survivors who viewed their reflections in a warpglass ooze maintain that the images never came true. Furthermore, victims of multiple warpglass oozes report that the images seen in each ooze are different and sometimes mutually inconsistent (such as a victim seeing himself freezing to death in a cave and later envisioning himself being roasted alive). Sages therefore agree that warpglass oozes don't actually provide any genuine foresight, but the question remains of where the oozes obtain the substance of their alluring reflections. Reflections are always dramatic-featuring benevolent heroics or nightmarish tortures, for example- which bolsters a theory that warpglass oozes somehow show glimpses of the infinite variations a victim's life might have taken.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Though warpglass oozes thrive in nearly any environment, they frequently drift toward rural, stony areas where standing water is common. They are not unheard of in urban areas, but they rarely survive long  there; larger cities don't provide the time and privacy the oozes need to lure, slay, and digest prey, while smaller villages become alarmed more quickly at missing residents and seek out threats. Warpglass oozes can survive in arctic or desert climates, although they grow sluggish in such conditions. In cold environments, warpglass oozes learn to stiffen their surface to more closely resemble a sheet of ice. Desert denizens are frequently protective of watering holes and suspicious of small, clear puddles, so warpglass oozes often lurk under stony overhangs or amid enticing hot springs.  Warpglass oozes aren't intelligent enough to form true societies, although pools of oozes sometimes work together. These pools often position one or two warpglass oozes to draw in prey, while the others slowly slink around behind their victims to cut off escape.  Few creatures have much use for the dangerous oozes except as near-mindless guardians. Nevertheless, some reclusive families of cliff giants (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 4</i> 126) atop the Storval Plateau keep and breed warpglass oozes. Able to safely handle the oozes due to their careful, patient training and resistance to the oozes' acid, these giants believe they can divine a person's fate by interpreting the reflected images and matching them with omens in the natural world.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Return_of_the_Runelords.jpg","_id":"SqDs6WAzF9QmdSRL"}

On a success, the PC senses that Runelord Thybidos harbors memories of awarding such items to his own favored servants. Forcefully presenting an <i>Abyssal runestone</i> is a standard action that forces Runelord Thybidos to attempt a DC 20 Will save; on a failure, the runelord ceases attacking. In this event, he drops to his knees, weeping, and begs the PCs t o bring him Xiren's remains once more. Runelord Thybidos remains in this state for 24 hours or until he is attacked again.  </p><p><strong>Quartered Curse (Su)</strong> When he is destroyed, Runelord  Thybidos unleashes a final curse on all creatures within a 30-foot radus. Affected creatures suffer increasingly mind-numbing and soul-crushing pain in the hips, shoulders, and neck. Each creature in the area must succeed at a DC 21 Will save or take 1d6 points of Constitution damage and 1d6 points of Charisma damage. The cursed creature doesn't benefit from effects that remove ability damage. Once cursed, the target must succeed at a Will save every 24 hours (at the same DC) or take the ability damage again. If either ability score is reduced to 0, the cursed creature's arms, legs, and head tear away from the torso in a spectacular display, killing the creature on the spot. A creature slain in this manner rise s as a ghost after 24 hours have passed and gains the quartered curse ability as a bonus special ability. A character who took part in either the apprentice's or soldier's ordeal gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against this curse (or a +8 bonus if they took part in both ordeals). The save DC is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Runelord's Wrath (Su)</strong> All creatures within a 30 -foot radius that can see Runelord Thybidos must succeed at a DC 21 Will save or be terrified into subservience. A creature that fails its saving throw gains the cowering condition for 1d4 rounds. A creature that successfully saves is not subject to this ability for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting fear effect, and the save DC is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Wrathful Fire (Su)</strong> Runelord Thybidos can shoot a beam of fire from his burning heart as a ranged touch attack with a range of 60 feet (no range increment). On a hit , this fire deals 3d6 points of fire damage. This does not provoke an attack of opportunity. He can use this a ttack and make both claw attacks in 1 round using a full attack action.

He can retrieve up to four of these icicles per round as a swift action. When wielded as a melee weapon, an icicle is considered a <i>+5 wounding rapier</i>. When wielded as thrown ranged weapons, the icicles are considered <i>+3 dagger</i>s. Icicles Inkariax retrieves from his flesh are immediately replaced, and he has hundreds of icicles embedded in his flesh that he can use for this purpose.  </p><p><strong>Cloak of Ice (Su)</strong> Inkariax is immune to cold damage as well as spells with the cold descriptor, and he always treats any difficult terrain that results from magical or mundane ice as normal terrain. He gains a profane bonus to his Armor Class equal to his Intelligence bonus.  </p><p><strong>Freezing Blast (Su)</strong> Inkariax can harness the power of absolute zero and release it in a burst around him with but a thought. Inkariax can use this ability five times per day as a standard action that doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity. When he does, creatures within 30 feet of him take 6d6 points of cold damage and 6d6 points of piercing damage that counts as evil and magic for the purpose of bypassing damage reduction. A successful DC 29 Fortitude saving throw halves both the cold and piercing damage. Additionally, creatures that fail this save must immediately attempt a DC 29 Will save. Failing this second save means a creature has been frozen solid and has become a supernaturally frozen, mindless, inert statue and is considered petrified, per <i>flesh to stone</i> (if the creature isn't made of flesh, this secondary ability has no effect). The creature can't be turned back to flesh by casting <i>stone to flesh</i>, but it can be restored via <i>break enchantment</i>. If the creature is not restored after a number of hours equal to the creature's Hit Dice, the creature dies and remains a perpetually frozen statue; it can't be returned to life except by the express intervention of a deity. The save DCs are Constitution-based.  </p><p><strong>Icy Logic (Su)</strong> Inkariax has absolute, logical control over the essence of cold. The save DCs for his spell-like abilities are based on his Intelligence rather than his Charisma. Additionally, at will, he can dispel any ongoing effect with the cold descriptor. This functions as <i>greater dispel magic</i>, although Inkariax automatically succeeds at any required dispel checks.  </p><p><strong>Unnerving Gaze (Ex)</strong> A creature that succumbs to Inkariax's unnerving gaze becomes stunned for 1d4 rounds as it becomes convinced that the demagogue's bloody icicles are working their way through its body, slowly transforming it into a frozen, blood-soaked exhibit in Inkariax's menagerie.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>The kyton demagogue known as the White Death is an ancient, mysterious, and aloof figure who dwells on the Plane of Shadow and is cloaked in the flesh-piercing  bloody icicles, some of which stitch his mouth closed. For millennia he has lurked in his realm of Frozen Tears, located atop a thick sheet of shadowy ice over a frigid sea.  Inkariax sprang fully formed from the plane's essence eons ago, terrible in his perfection, with flesh sculpted of ice and unadulterated, if surprisingly refined, sadism. The demagogue spent untold ages wandering the cosmos looking for the perfect place to keep his collection of wickedly preserved innocents, leaving carnage and abandoned menageries of victims along the way. When he finally happened upon the wastes that would become the Frozen Tears, Inkariax felt a surging empathic link with Doloras, the Queen of the Night of dispassion, whom he believed freed the entire kyton species from Hell. He then began constructing an elaborate and terrible citadel and surrounding realm from the sheer evil of the landscape before him. The screams of the first victims of Inkariax and his kytons are said to be woven into the realm's fabric in such a way as to drive any creature fool enough to stumble upon them to heinous thought and deeds.  Shortly after he claimed the territory, the Queen of the Night appeared unbidden in Inkariax's nascent realm. She spoke not a word to Inkariax, whose lost voice is said to be so horrific that its throaty growl could end civilizations. Instead, she merely gave him a wan glance and gifted him tears harvested from her diadem-her symbol of power. These gifts Inkariax turned into the <i>pendants of the first tears</i> (see page 12). Doloras wordlessly left that day, but ever since, Inkariax has seen her as the perfect, like-minded ally, and he has spent millennia attempting to again catch her attention with monuments and havens for her worshippers in his realm. It is unclear whether Doloras is testing the demagogue, playing a long game to destroy him, or merely taking her time to ally with him, but the unholy churches of Inkariax and her worshippers are tightly connected.  Inkariax himself is a cosmic mystery, even beyond his would-be alliance with the Queen of the Night. He never speaks, cares nothing of mortals, and is rarely seen outside his palace, called White Death's Diadem. However, the demagogue can take the form of his favored servants, libitinarii kytons (see page 84) at any time, and he roams the planes in this guise to further his plans. All libitinarii kytons receive particular respect from canny outsiders, as none know whether one of the grim fiends is actually Inkariax in disguise. The demagogue's isolation and the regimented nature of his realm are also attractive to devils and other expatriates from Hell who crave order but appreciate Inkariax's aloofness. Some say that Inkariax is secretly building an army of such devils to present to Doloras as a gift should she ever return to his realm. It's more likely, though, that the demagogue  is simply focused on building his horrific menageries of mutilated goodly creatures, turning his realm into the ultimate macabre museum of torturous preservation- which might also one day win him the Queen of Night's true attention.  Information about Inkariax's boons and obediences appears on page 120 of <i>Pathfinder RPG</i>: <i>Book of the</i> <i>Damned</i>, and further information about him appears on page 77 of this book.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Return_of_the_Runelords.jpg","_id":"Y8QvfkBf1Rk8d0YU"}

It uses spell combat to fight with its urumi while also casting spells as full-round actions. In the first round, Srishrin casts <i>greater invisibility</i> on itself, then <i>mirror image</i> in the next round, and then offensive spells in rounds to follow. It attempts to use temporal <i>displacement</i> on any particularly troublesome opponents.</p><p><strong>Morale </strong>From Srishrin's perspective, it has already faced the PCs once and been defeated, and the time flayer will not stand for another such humiliation from these time-bound mortals.

This ability prevents it from being surprised, caught flat-footed, or flanked. It also grants Srishrin an insight bonus to AC equal to its Wisdom bonus. This ability can be negated, but Srishrin can restart it as a free action on its next turn.  </p><p><strong>Immunity to Temporal Magic (Ex)</strong> Srishrin is immune to all time-related spells and effects (including <i>time stop</i>, <i>temporal stasis</i>, and the like).  </p><p><strong>Reality Bend (Su)</strong> As a swift action, Srishrin can fold the dimensional space surrounding it so its true location is hard to discern. Srishrin can activate this ability after it is hit in battle to suddenly not be  where it was the moment before, giving it a 50% miss chance it can apply to successful strikes after they occur (but before damage is rolled). This is similar to the miss chance granted by a <i>displacement</i> spell. Casting <i>see invisibility</i> does not reveal Srishrin's location, but casting <i>true seeing</i> does.  </p><p><strong>Temporal Displacement (Su)</strong> As a +12 melee touch attack up to three times per day, Srishrin can attempt to send a creature a few seconds into the future. The creature touched can resist being temporally displaced with a successful DC 21 Fortitude save. On a failed save, the creature <i>vanish</i>es in a flash of white light, only to reappear in the same space 1d4 rounds later. If that space is occupied when the creature returns, it is shunted harmlessly aside to the closest unoccupied space. The save DC is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Time Jaunt (Su)</strong> As a standard action, Srishrin can slip through the flow of time and appear anywhere on the same plane of existence as if by <i>greater teleport</i>.

Whenever a creature within 60 feet of a time dimensional casts <i>time stop</i>, the time dimensional can act normally as if it had cast <i>time stop</i> itself for the same effective duration. As neither the time dimensional nor the caster is frozen in time with respect to the other, each can target and affect the other with attacks, spells, or other effects they create, though neither can affect frozen creatures for the duration of the <i>time stop</i>.

These beings do not name themselves, but they are called time dimensionals by extraplanar scholars. Time dimensionals travel across the Great Beyond to confront and neutralize threats to the timestream. In some cases, this involves the removal of a disruptive individual or item, while in other cases it simply means delaying events long enough for the flow of time to correct itself. In the event of egregious disruptions, several time dimensionals may work together in perfect synchronicity to preserve the timestream.  The very existence of time dimensionals can disrupt the flow of normal time, so the Dimension of Time dispatches a time dimensional for only the exact duration required; furthermore, a time dimensional uses only the minimum amount of force necessary to fulfill its duties. As the exact nature of time is fickle and never completely known, those who devote their lives to the study of time are unsure as to which events trigger a time dimensional's appearance and which do not. Time dimensionals have appeared during seemingly mundane events, such as the  report of a dozen time dimensionals appearing to a group of miners in Brevoy in the summer of 4284 ar. More confounding are events that appear to be an obvious call to time dimensionals, such as the appearance of the legendary <i>Scepter of Ages</i>, but that the dimensionals seem to ignore.  A time dimensional can manipulate the flow of time as it affects nearby matter, with effects such as locking other creatures out of time's progression or aging an item so quickly it is effectively <i>disintegrate</i>d. It has even greater control over its own temporal positioning, allowing it to move quickly around a battlefield and obtain comprehensive knowledge of where its enemies will strike. There are reports of exceptionally rare time dimensionals with greater abilities-such as the ability to erase a creature from time entirely-though the Dimension of Time dispatches such dimensionals only to deal with the most calamitous of situations.  A time dimensional typically stands at 12 feet tall and weighs about 300 pounds.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p> As time dimensionals are incredibly rare creatures, much of the information about them is no more than speculation. Many conflate time dimensionals with elementals, but the nature of a time dimensional is very different. Elementals are formed from the raw matter serving as the principal building blocks of the Elemental Planes (although this matter exists throughout the Material Plane and, indeed, across the Great Beyond). A time dimensional, however, is a living portion of the Dimension of Time itself, which implies a measure of inherent sapience in that plane that the Elemental Planes lack.  A time dimensional has a nearly perfect knowledge of its own past and future, obtained by its constant connection to the Dimension of Time. Whether this connection means that a time dimensional is an extension of that demiplane, like the arm of a creature, or merely in constant mental communion with it, as if part of a hive mind, remains a subject of conjecture.  Time dimensionals are too powerful for most mortal magic to conjure, and their true names were erased from mortal knowledge in some impossibly ancient time. A <i>gate</i> spell could, in theory, beckon one of these creatures to serve, but even then the act of drawing a time dimensional out of the demiplane of Time might be enough to pull more of their kind to investi<i>gate</i>- and likely punish-the conjurer. Those who persist in attempting to summon or bind time dimensionals often earn their ire, or else draw the attention of dangerous creatures such as hounds of Tindalos (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2</i> 158).  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  As time dimensionals exist only at the will of the Dimension of Time, they have no definite society and do not congre<i>gate</i> in groups outside of the Dimension of Time unless dispatched on a specific mission. Whether these creatures have formed a society of their own in the Dimension of Time is unknown, as that plane is nearly impossible to access or study.  Some speculate that there is, in fact, only a single time dimensional, and appearances of multiple ones arise from sightings of the same creature crossing and recrossing its own temporal path, meeting later or earlier incarnations of itself. In this theory, the Dimension of Time created the first and only time dimensional at the birth of time and dispatches the same one to deal with all temporal disruptions, and therefore rumors of time dimensionals with more powerful abilities are sightings of an older or advanced version of the same creature. Too much research into this model appears to be dangerous, however, as chronomancers and temporal scholars who investi<i>gate</i> the most advanced time dimensionals often disappear entirely.

They have little concern for other creatures except as food, but particularly prize the taste of intelligent prey. Fortunately, the creatures are as lazy as they are hungry; despite their aggressive dispositions, they rarely rouse themselves from their mountain lairs to assail the smorgasbord of civilization.  Bollas have exceptionally keen vision, thanks to their silvery compound eyes. When disturbed, they often feign sleep or sluggishness to lure intruders close before lashing out with surprising speed. Their bite inflicts a magical lethargy on foes, making targets easy meals for the gluttonous beasts.  A typical bolla is 30 feet long and weighs 2 tons.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p> Born of foul experiments performed by the runelords of Haruka at the height of the Thassilonian empire, bollas are creatures of gluttony and sloth conceived as living weapons to further the machinations of their magical masters. Designed by Runelord Ivarinna and developed by her successor, Krune, the runelords' goal was to create a voracious war machine that could be easily returned to a torpor when not in active use. Bollas were bred from monstrous serpents native to the mountains of Haruka and infused with the essences of fiends, linnorms, and even stranger creatures of storm and sky. Due in part to Krune's preference for conjuring beasts when needed rather than engaging in the laborious process of breeding creatures over time, and in part to general indolence, bollas were never perfected and were deployed only sporadically.  Bollas can remain in hibernation for many years. When not hibernating, they are driven by their ravenous urges and eagerly attack any creatures unlucky enough to cross its path. When given the opportunity, bollas prefer to attack intelligent creatures first, plucking knights from horseback or slithering around hunting animals to get at their humanoid handlers.  Despite their vicious temperaments, bollas are intelligent, sometimes stalking foes for hours to analyze the foes' strengths and weaknesses before striking. When faced with multiple foes, bollas slither through the battlefield, cursing or swallowing weaker enemies to buy time to concentrate on tougher targets. On rare occasions, a bolla might strike a deal with creatures it finds too powerful to defeat, but these negotiations are always aimed at feeding its endless hunger.  An adverse side effect of bollas' experimental origin is their keen but delicate compound eyes. While the mirror sheen of a bolla's eyes makes it impossible to determine exactly where the creature is looking-and even conceals whether it is currently asleep or awake-its  eyes are particularly fragile. A bolla that has been robbed of its sight is both pitiful and desperate, lashing out haphazardly in a roaring frenzy.  Bollas dislike others of their kind and usually attack them on sight. When the creatures occasionally come together to mate, they produce a small clutch of eggs and leave it in an isolated cave or canyon. The first bolla to hatch eats its siblings before taking a long rest, and thus begins its life alternating between gluttony and torpor. Unless killed by accident or violence, bollas can survive for millennia.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  During the time of Thassilon, Runelord Krune's agents deployed bollas as tools of extermination, loosing them into enemy camps to devour the inhabitants in a gluttonous frenzy. Once no more victims remained in a camp, the bollas would rest and their handlers would retrieve them. These handlers relied on powerful magic items to pacify bollas, as the beasts were always irascible, no matter how sated, and never truly loyal.  In the aftermath of Earthfall, the surviving bollas retreated to the far corners of Golarion to wait out the darkness. A bolla that has been hibernating for a year might consume only a single person and then resume its slumber, while one in hibernation since Earthfall could embark on a nation-devouring rampage once it finally awakens.  Unlike most creatures that hibernate for extended periods of time, bollas get stronger, rather than weaker, the longer they rest. Over years or decades, their bodies draw upon the fiendish essences instilled in their nature, growing more powerful and vicious. The outward manifestations of this metamorphosis are twofold. First, a hibernating bolla slowly sheds and replaces its furry skin, recovering from any injuries and regenerating any missing appendages. Second, its tongue grows and splits. While younger bollas have the familiar forked tongue of a snake, older bollas exhibit multiple tongue splits-their maws are filled with tangled masses of red, fleshy ribbons. Older bollas sometimes develop into kulshedras (see below). A bolla's growth is slowed when it regularly consumes intelligent creatures, as the bolla feeds on the ephemeral spiritual residue of its victims rather than its own inner fiendish essence. Rumors tell  of isolated settlements that make offerings of criminals or unlucky travelers to appease a bolla, hoping to keep its growth in check with these sacrifices.  <br /><strong>KULSHEDRAS</strong><br />  When a bolla has gone without eating an intelligent victim long enough for its tongue to split into nine forks, it undergoes a final, sinister metamorphosis. The bolla sheds its skin one last time and emerges as a kulshedra. Kulshedras are just as voracious as their lesser bolla kin, but they are more crafty and wicked. Kulshedras seek to cause strife on as wide a scale as possible, favoring indirect means such as conjuring storms and causing droughts. They enjoy watching desperate communities tear themselves apart. Unlike bollas, kulshedras do not hibernate, and they instead spend their time plotting the destruction of nearby communities. Kulshedras are bollas with the giant and fiendish simple templates. They gain an additional +4 bonus on combat maneuver checks to grapple foes due to their many tongues and gain <i>control weather</i> as a spell-like ability usable once per day.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Return_of_the_Runelords.jpg","_id":"bsKGlnlqGgVu9qVF"}

It can emerge from this form as a full-round action, but doing so leaves it staggered for 1 round.  </p><p><strong>Tentacular Versatility (Ex)</strong> A vexenion's tentacles are treated as primary attacks. As a swift action at the start of its turn, a vexenion can devote one or more of its four tentacles to movement or defense, reducing the number of tentacle attacks it can make in that round by the same amount. Each tentacle devoted to movement increases the vexenion's base speed and climb speed by 5 feet. Each tentacle devoted to defense grants the vexenion a +1 dodge bonus to its AC for 1 round.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>The Abyssal realm of Sekatar-Seraktis is a byword for chaos, contested by 13 different potential rulers split between bickering balor lords, vavakias, and vrolikais, yet all leave the portion of the plane claimed by the qlippoth lord Yamasoth alone. The Kingdom of New Flesh is populated by the unholy experiments of the qlippoth lord, ravenous monstrosities who feed upon one another and any other beings so foolish or unlucky as to wind up in this accursed place. Some of the most fecund of these experiments are called vexenions, and they have proliferated across the Abyss. These abominations have the appearance of enormous bloated, pulsating tumors, mouthless, armed with muscular tentacles sprouting from their glistening form and gifted with bulging eyes capable of protruding from their bodies and just as quickly disappearing into their shuddering wet flesh.  A vexenion feeds on flesh by physically absorbing creatures into its own amorphous form through its membranous skin. The ingested creature is <i>slow</i>ly dissolved by the qlippoth's acid. Once the flesh is consumed, the victim's bones and other indigestible parts are expelled, and the vexenion moves on to its next meal, forever hunting, forever hungry.  Vexenions often serve as shock troops in qlippoth armies, sent in the vanguard of attacks to break the formations of an advancing force, grappling and absorbing enemy soldiers in their path. While it is believed that Yamasoth employs these sickening things  to gather material for its own endless experiments, the qlippoth lord seems to care little where the vexenions travel. For this reason, the creatures proliferate like a plague across the Abyss. Perhaps this is Yamasoth's ultimate intent.  Vexenions are at home in nearly any environment where they can find flesh on which to feast, though they often lair in places where they might easily ambush prey: demonic crossroads, ruins, and blasted forests where they can use the high limbs and trunks of dead trees to ambulate above their unknowing prey. In fact, this is the qlippoth's preferred method of stalking potential meals: suspended above, employing their impressive climbing skills to move from tree to tree. Caverns of stalactites or the pillars of ruined demon cities can serve the same purpose for them.  Despite their hideous, almost ooze-like appearance, vexenions are intelligent creatures. They lack the apparatus for speech but delight in telepathically sharing their hungers and the flavors of their food with others around them, impassively inquiring about their victim's favored flavors and meals. The vexenion's unsettling habit of sharing the flavors of a creature it feeds upon with that creature as it digests them is perhaps the qlippoth's most sadistic trait.  Temples of Yamasoth and other places where his otherworldly and malign presence has infected the world, such as the deeper levels of Hollow Mountain, are no stranger to the predations of the vexenion. Dungeon complexes are well loved by these qlippoth, and despite their prodigious size, their malleable bodies allow them to slither and squirt and force themselves through narrow confines-provided their bodies are not currently engorged upon a still-solid and still-struggling meal.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p> Vexenions reproduce asexually. When one has consumed sufficient quantities of flesh, it finds a hiding place and goes into a kind of senseless larval state, its eyes and tentacles retreating into itself. The exterior flesh of the thing quickly hardens into a stony shell; in this form, they are difficult to discern from surrounding rocks. After 24 hours, two fully grown vexenion burst forth from the shell, each of which retains the memories of  the original. While gestating in this shell, the vexenion stews in a rancid-smelling slurry of amniotic fluid that has strange effects on potions, elixirs, and similar magic items if used as an additional component when creating the magical liquid (merely mixing the fluid with an already created potion or elixir ruins the magic drink). A character can harvest a gestating vexenion's fluids with a successful DC 21 Survival check, after which the fluid must be refined in an alchemical lab over the course of 8 hours with a successful DC 20 Craft (alchemy) check. A single vexenion can supply a single dose of fluid in this manner. Used as an additional resource during potion or elixir creation, the fluid has a 50% chance of causing the resulting potion or elixir to function at a caster level 2 higher than normal, and a 50% chance of instead causing the potion or elixir to function normally but to nauseate the drinker for 1 round after it is imbibed. A single dose of vexenion catalyst, as the prepared fluid is known, is worth 1,000 gp.  Vexenions are often confused with nyogoths (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2</i> 224), in whose company they are sometimes found. However, vexenions are more intelligent and better able to set up ambushes and traps for unsuspecting prey. Fortunately for nyogoths, they are among the only creatures in the Great Beyond that vexenions find unpalatable.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Return_of_the_Runelords.jpg","_id":"drkPuxowqFQbb24J"}

When an iron sentinel detects a trespasser, it can choose to alert the creature to which it's keyed in one of two ways. The sentinel can create a loud sound like that of a bell, chime, or gong that can be clearly heard within 500 feet. Alternatively, an iron sentinel can send a mental alert to the creature to which it is keyed as long as that creature is within 1 mile of the sentinel. The mental alert wakes the keyed creature from sleep but doesn't affect normal concentration. An iron sentinel's creator is the first creature it is keyed to, and the creator can pass its link to another creature as part of a 4-hour ritual that uses materials costing 500 gp.  </p><p><strong>Head-Butt (Ex)</strong> Once every 3 rounds, if an iron sentinel hits the same creature with both claw attacks, it can also attempt to head-butt that creature. If this attack is successful, in addition to the damage, the target is staggered for 1 round unless it succeeds at a DC 14 Fortitude save. The save DC is Constitution-based.  </p><p><strong>Icy Bolt (Su)</strong> As a standard action, an iron sentinel can fire a bolt of ice as a ranged touch attack out to a maximum range of 30 feet. This bolt deals 1d6 points of cold damage. The target is also slowed (as per the spell slow) for 1d6+1 rounds (a DC 14 Fortitude save negates this slow effect). The save DC is Constitution-based.  </p><p><strong>Immunity to Magic (Ex)</strong> An iron sentinel is immune to spells or spell-like abilities that allow spell resistance, except for spells with the electricity descriptor.  Popular in the more brutish Thassilonian lands of Bakrakhan, Gastash, and Haruka, iron sentinels were commonly employed in large platoons to repel organized, armed assaults. They most often begin combat with an icy bolt intended to slow advancing hostiles, who are then easier targets for the constructs' physical attacks.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Iron Sentinel <br /><strong>Construction</strong><br />  Though the exact process of creating the base form differs depending on the materials involved, the process of animating sentinels is roughly the same, regardless of the specific type of sentinel being created. (The statue atop which the sentinel often perches is not a part of its total cost). Each sentinel must be carved or worked in fine detail before being subjected to spells and magical unguents worth 1,000 gp.  <br /></p><div class=\"heading\"><p class=\"alignleft\">Iron Sentinel</p>  <strong>CL</strong> 14th; <strong>Price</strong> 28,000 gp  <br /><hr /><strong>Construction</strong><hr />  <strong>Requirements</strong> Craft Construct, <i>alarm</i>, <i>cone of cold</i>, <i>detect magic</i>, <i>geas/quest</i>, <i>limited wish</i>; <strong>Skill</strong> Craft (sculpture) DC 22; <strong>Cost</strong> 14,000 gp</div></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Return_of_the_Runelords.jpg","_id":"g4MEf0qTtHo9ezWw"}

A basavan in forest terrain gains the greensight universal monster rule (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 4</i> 295) with a range of 60 feet.

In addition, Knowledge (nature) is a class skill for basavans.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Covered in shaggy hair that envelops the entirety of their immense bodies other than their faces, basavans resemble exceptionally hirsute giants. Wise and peaceful stewards of the wilderness, basavans protect the plants and animals that share their homes in wooded mountains across Golarion. Basavans are likely to let unwitting trespassers off with a warning, but against predators and poachers they deal powerful blows with staves and stones, using their innate connection to the land to locate and trap their foes.  Basavans are 24 feet tall and weigh 17,000 pounds.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p> Basavans are reclusive creatures who spend their whole lives in isolated mountain valleys or ranging through hillside forests. The few aware of the existence of basavans-normally druids and other wilderness protectors-know them to be staunch defenders of the wilderness, yet none agree on where and when basavans originated. The basavans themselves claim to be as old as the forests but not quite as old as the mountains, but they deliver this information with a merry twinkle in their eyes. Basavans bear children only rarely, and in such seclusion that young basavans are virtually never seen by anyone other than their parents until they mature and join them in protecting their lands. Young basavans, born entirely hairless and with skin that resembles thick bark, appear very different from their parents. They grow their hair quickly as they age, but shed all of it twice in their youth. A basavan's hair is usually dark brown, but might be black, tawny, or even deep auburn. Basavans consider their hair useful for warmth and in their daily work, such as to make crude twine or as nesting material for animals, but they rarely take care of it and therefore have a shaggy, wild appearance.  A basavan designates a wide strip of primeval forest or mountains as its personal protected domain; often, this area is dozens or hundreds of square miles in size. A basavan usually keeps intruders out of its lands personally, although a few that share a border with hermits, trappers, or shepherds teach these hardy folk how to identify and repel intruders as well. Basavans tend to injured plants and animals in their personal domains, creating a lush bounty and safe haven for animals.  Basavans are herbivores, and most subsist on only a small meal every few days. Despite their limited diet,  basavans are incredibly massive, with powerful muscles and robust constitutions. They are remarkably athletic, able to scale cliffs and swim across rough rivers with ease. Basavans bring a focused efficiency to even the most physically demanding labor, but they take care to avoid disturbing vegetation or upsetting wildlife even when traveling quickly across their terrain.  Basavans are skilled smiths, and most devote their lives to a single type of craft, such as working with iron, stone, or wood. Although they generally don't maintain lairs, as they prefer to sleep in the wild, they often hollow out caves to use as a forges or workshops, expanding their caves as they age. Basavans use the simple tools they create in their stewardship of the land or as gifts to nearby peaceful communities.  These hardy creatures age very slowly and generally live to be 600 or 700 years old. Elderly basavans become true masters of the crafts they pursue.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Although basavans are reclusive, a rare few of these hairy giants venture out into communities near their protected lands. Such basavans sometimes consider nearby shepherds, farmers, or settlers to be under their protection, and they might help rebuild a home destroyed by a flood or round up livestock lost in a storm. Although basavans almost never hunt or kill animals, they don't mind when humanoids under their protection do. They enjoy imparting ancient secrets of farming or animal husbandry to such neighbors, encouraging a deeper respect for the local environment. These communities might engineer a system to summon their guardian basavan in the event of a raid, natural disaster, or other serious need; such warning systems often consist of bells, whistles, or bright flags. A basavan withholds its protection and training from those who demonstrate a wanton disregard for the land, such as by being reckless with fire or butchering animals for sport. These actions provoke the normally peaceful creatures into a rage, causing them to exile or even kill the offenders.  Basavans rarely gather in large groups, and some might go their entire lives without seeing more than a handful of others of their kind. When they do gather in small groups, such as families, basavans work together in an eerie unison that hints at some deep mutual communion. In these groups, males defer to females for protection, as the females tend to be larger and stronger,  but in other matters the basavans tend to defer to the oldest among them.  Because of the old lore basavans keep, many sages, druids, and explorers seek them out in order to gain their knowledge. Visitors must be prepared with a deep well of patience and work for days or weeks to prove they have at least rudimentary skill in woodcraft or caring for animals. During this time, even if the basavan doesn't show itself to the visitor, it is watchful for any slip that might reveal anything other than benevolent intentions toward the natural world. Once a visitor proves herself, however, the basavan is a gracious host and eager to share its guidance. Some basavans display a sly wit in these conversations, making lighthearted jokes at their visitors' expense.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Return_of_the_Runelords.jpg","_id":"h3lMCoMYVR1I8mZA"}

When it makes a full attack with both bows, the penalties for fighting with two weapons apply  and can be offset with feats such as Two-Weapon Fighting. The japalisura can apply extra attacks from other sources, such as Manyshot or Rapid Shot, to only one of its bows per round. For the purpose of calculating the penalties for fighting with two weapons, a japalisura treats shortbows and composite shortbows as light weapons, and it treats other bows as one-handed weapons.  </p><p><strong>Hateful Prophecy (Sp)</strong> A japalisura can cast <i>augury</i> or <i>divination</i> for a willing creature, in which case the spell provides information that pertains to that creature's future rather than that of the asura. Upon completing the casting of the spell-like ability, the japalisura can attempt a Profession (soothsayer) check opposed by the creature's Sense Motive check. If successful, the japalisura twists the prophecy in such a way to convey impending violence or betrayal, subjecting the creature to the effects of <i>vengeful outrage</i> (Pathfinder <i>RPG Ultimate Magic</i> 246) with an indicated enemy of the asura's choice. The creature can resist the <i>vengeful outrage</i> effect with a successful DC 20 Will saving throw. The save DC is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Infernal Arrows (Su)</strong> As a swift action, a japalisura with at least one free hand can create 10 mundane arrows. It can have no more than 20 such arrows in existence at a time, and its arrows are always destroyed when fired, whether they hit their target or not.  </p><p><strong>Selective Nondetection (Su)</strong> A japalisura automatically succeeds at caster level checks to bypass its elusive aura.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Thinking her divine realm so glorious that all must envy it, a goddess once sought a powerful oracle to identify her enemies. The oracle told her that she had no reason to fear invaders, for her death and ruin would come from the covetous barbs of enemies within. Distressed, the goddess returned to her palace, scoured her halls for any such traitors, and at last came upon her three demigod children practicing archery. Certain that her children would one day slay her, she tore them to pieces and cast their bodies and bows far from her realm. The first japalisura formed from these eviscerated remains.  A japalisura is 7 feet tall and weighs 150 pounds.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p> Despite having a single mind to control many limbs, japalisuras are exceptionally dexterous and capable of performing numerous tasks simultaneously. They easily operate two bows at once, smoothly alternating between reloading and firing. Japalisuras never want for ammunition, plucking arrows from the air as if drawing them from some invisible quiver. It's unclear from where exactly these arrows originate, although every japalisura's ammunition shares the same fletching and design. One theory is that these asuras are drawing replicas of the arrows carried by the slain demigods, though effects that  inhibit summoning don't impede their ability to draw forth these arrows in any way.  Japalisuras have a knack for extracting embarrassing truths from the universe, hatefully manipulating their prophecies as though they were independent or even in defiance of conventional soothsaying. Where magic fails, they are adept at reading humanoid emotions, making up attractive lies and pandering to biases to confirm their clients' worst fears and prejudices.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Like most asuras, japalisuras favor temples and churches as their lairs. The more a location is associated with prophecy, the better. As a result, japalisuras often settle in and around druids' groves, oracular caves, cyclops lairs, and the like, especially if those locations continue to attract the occasional pilgrim seeking answers. This makes abandoned sacred sites of Magdh, Pharasma, and Sivanah especially attractive. Japalisuras take a special delight in identifying perilous romantic relationships, posing as servants of Naderi and stealthily presenting at least one of the lovers with predictions of future difficulties to encourage self-destructive behavior.  Japalisuras know that their fearsome miens tend to distress visitors, yet the asuras lack any supernatural means of disguising themselves. Instead, many japalisuras favor hiding out of sight and dealing with visitors from behind screens or within darkened alcoves. In these circumstances, the asura rarely emerges unless doing so would convince a reticent visitor to cooperate or if necessary to destroy someone who poses a threat to the asura's ongoing operations. Rarely, a japalisura operates openly, relying on either its reputation or its monstrous allure to attract disciples. Such is the case for Holkomion of Iblydos, who claims to have rediscovered the sacred art of myth-speaking. At least one warrior claims to have attained mythic power as a result of Holkomion's guidance, yet most find that the japalisura's prophecies in fact direct petitioners to assassinate hero-gods.  More often, a japalisura maintains a small cult to communicate its oracular guidance. A japalisura accepts only the most devout followers into such coteries. With such humanoid puppets, the asura  can dispense <i>divination</i>s telepathically without having to show itself. These cults take myriad forms but typically operate outside of large population centers to avoid too much scrutiny. The japalisura Zalmiac poses as the Varisian harrower Madame Vhelanosz, virtually never leaving the wagon from which she interprets her cards. Her pernicious prophecies have incited scores of murders-especially against Desnans and Pharasmins, whom she goads into killing each other-and her loyal cohort of ex-Sczarni assistants ensure nobody asks too many of the wrong questions.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Return_of_the_Runelords.jpg","_id":"jZ9OthvxDzS0iCqO"}

As a swift action that doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity, a chronogeist can oscillate its essence rapidly between the current temporal landscape and an infinite number of others, passing through the bodies of all corporeal creatures within a 30-foot radius. Affected creatures take 6d6 points of damage (this damage occurs from rapid aging and cell death and doesn't have a damage type). A successful DC 26 Will save negates this damage. Any creature who fails the save is also nauseated for 1 round as a result of the disorienting attack. The chronogeist can use this ability three <i>time</i>s per day, but not more often than once every 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Temporal Screech (Su)</strong> As a standard action three <i>time</i>s per day, a chronogeist can unleash an ear-splitting screech that causes the flow of <i>time</i> around it to stutter. Creatures within  30 feet that can hear the screech must attempt a DC 26 Will saving throw. Those that succeed are unaffected, but those that fail superficially age, their muscles and joints locking up and their movement slowing. For the next 3 rounds, affected creatures can move at only half speed, and take a -8 penalty on Strength- and Dexterity-based checks and abilities, including AC, ranged and melee attack and damage rolls, and skill checks. A creature affected by a chronogeist's temporal screech (whether or not its saving throw was successful) can't be affected by it again for the next 24 hours. This is a sonic effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Time Rejuvenation (Su)</strong> Whenever a chronogeist is within 60 feet of a creature that begins to cast a transmutation or necromancy spell that affects the passage of <i>time</i> (including, but not limited to <i>haste</i>, <i>sands of <i>time</i></i>, <i>slow</i>, <i>temporal stasis</i>, threefold aspect, or <i>time</i> stop), the chronogeist immediately absorbs a portion of the spell's energy. The spell still functions as normal, but the chronogeist gains a number of temporary hit points equal to 10 <i>time</i>s the spell's level. These temporary hit points are lost first when the chronogeist takes damage and can stack with each other.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>For thousands of years after it became trapped in Crystilan, Xin-Edasseril existed apart from planar space and <i>time</i>. While the city remained safe from intrusion, its residents were unaware that they were trapped within a temporal prison, replaying the same week-long period over and over. The city's inhabitants never aged, but the souls of those who died couldn't escape to the Boneyard. Instead, these trapped souls festered within the demiplane, and over the course of centuries transformed into terrifying, incorporeal undead creatures called chronogeists.  With each week's reset, the citizens of Crystilan who had perished in the previous incarnation of the city simply vanished from the memories of those who survived, their passage from life to death wiped clean due to the nature of <i>time</i> within the demiplane being constantly reset. Yet some<i>time</i>s, people would vaguely recall those who had perished in the form of half-remembered dreams, and as the presence of chronogeists <i>slow</i>ly grew, theories as to their nature began to spread through the city's scholars. Some correctly suspected they were tied to a distortion in <i>time</i>, but most believed they were manifestations of dreams or forgotten memories that sought vengeance upon those who had misremembered them. Of course, at the end of every week, with the resetting of <i>time</i>, these theories would all be forgotten.  Over the years, the number of citizens in Xin-Edasseril <i>slow</i>ly decreased while chronogeists continued to manifest. Fortunately for the city's inhabitants, once a chronogeist was slain, it didn't return to life with the next week's reset-instead, this trapped spiritual energy simply got absorbed into the shell surrounding Crystilan.  This growing spiritual pressure on the demiplane's borders is yet another factor that led to its recent destabilization when the Sihedron Heroes harvested energy from the demiplane's shell using the <i>Timeglass</i>.  Now that <i>time</i> once again flows forward normally, newly dead souls in Crystilan don't become trapped and are free to enter the Boneyard normally. Yet for the hundreds of souls still trapped in a strange limbo as a chronogeist, only the destruction of Crystilan itself can allow their escape to the afterlife.  Chronogeists are incorporeal, and their forms typically resemble far more wicked and angry versions of their appearance before undeath. Unhealthy, pale yellow, or orange lights typically permeate chronogeists, though they flash a gamut of bright colors when they harness the unstable <i>time</i> within them to attack those who disturb them. Chronogeists typically wear ghostly vestments of the clothes they wore when they died or clothing that was heavily associated with them in life, such as a priest's robes or a soldier's uniform.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p> When chronogeists arise, they typically haunt the general area of their death, confused and distraught about why they persist. They lose most memories they held in life and become enraged, aggressive threats to any who happen upon their territory, screeching and flying through victims' bodies in an attempt to right the temporal snags and instability that led to their undeath. This doesn't mean that chronogeists are unintelligent, however. Rather, chronogeists exist in a pure state of emotion and denial; they don't understand that a snag in <i>time</i> has prevented their souls' journeys, but are enraged that they're stuck on the Material Plane or elsewhere, so they continue to unleash the temporal dangers within them in fruitless attempts to understand their own natures.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Chronogeists have no sense of companionship or interpersonal relations. They barely recognize that they're no longer their former mortal selves, and in death have become near-mindless evil creatures. Chronogeists whose progenitor creatures held particularly strong convictions, however, some<i>time</i>s retain a sliver of an important memory-such as whether they once vowed to protect someone or something with their lives. These chronogeists still typically haunt the relevant areas, and might even still make efforts to fulfill an important vow they made in life, even if they don't recognize why or how they're doing so. These actions typically manifest in tragically ironic forms, such as a chronogeist forgetting entirely why it's protecting  an area even while the subject of its previous concern, such as a precious artifact, lies forgotten in the dust.  In most cases, it's rare for more than one chronogeist to haunt an area, since the creatures are territorial and are usually tightly tied to the place where they died. In places where temporal events are common or where the fabric of <i>time</i> is unstable, however, many chronogeists might arise spontaneously in a single location. When this happens, these chronogeists tend to move together, roving their territory for intruders or blindly trying to fulfill some mission they held dearly in life. Like when they operate alone, these chronogeists barely realize that they're working with others of their kind or to what end. They simply continue to rage against any living creatures that intrude upon their haunts, desperately seeking to understand their complex and tragic fate.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Return_of_the_Runelords.jpg","_id":"jcAWfN2ZQWMga8nH"}

It can retrieve up to four of these icicles per round as a free action. These icicles deal piercing damage equal to 1d8 plus the libitinarii's Strength modifier (usually +6) plus 2d6 points of cold damage; they deal triple damage on a critical hit (although the cold damage is not increased). The icicles aren't considered magic weapons, but they  are supernaturally hardened and count as adamantine for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. Once the libitinarii has retrieved icicles from its flesh, new icicles immediately form as a free action. If the libitinarii's regeneration is suppressed, it also can't form new icicles. A libitinarii typically has 24 icicles embedded in its flesh at any time.  </p><p><strong>Icy Fiend (Ex)</strong> A libitinarii's body is made from an unholy union of soulstuff and the icy essence of the coldest reaches of the Shadow Plane. As such, the libitinarii is immune to cold, and it can treat any difficult terrain that results from magical or mundane ice as normal terrain, such as the icy terrain of the Frozen Tears, realm of the kyton demagogue Inkariax.  </p><p><strong>Perfect Freeze (Su)</strong> A libitinarii can harness the power of absolute zero and impose it upon the body of a living creature with a touch. The libitinarii can use this ability three times per day as a standard action that doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity. If the libitinarii's touch attack is successful, the target takes 2d6 points of cold damage and 2d6 points of evil-aligned magic damage. A successful DC 23 Fortitude saving throw halves each type of damage. Additionally, creatures that fail this saving throw must immediately attempt a DC 23 Will saving throw. Failing this second saving throw means that a creature has been frozen solid and has become a supernaturally frozen, mindless, inert statue and is considered petrified, per <i>flesh to stone</i> (if the creature is not made of flesh, this secondary ability has no effect). The creature can't be turned back to flesh by casting <i>stone to flesh</i> spell, but it can be restored via casting <i>break enchantment</i>. If the creature isn't returned to flesh after a number of hours equal to the creature's Hit Dice, the creature dies and remains a frozen statue. It can be returned to life normally by casting <i>raise dead</i> or similar spells. This is a cold effect. The save DCs are Constitution-based.  </p><p><strong>Unnerving Gaze (Ex)</strong> A creature that succumbs to a libitinarii's unnerving gaze becomes staggered for 1 round as it feels itself slowly freezing from the inside out.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Libitinariis form from the souls of cold-obsessed spellcasters, wicked taxidermists, torturers partial to using frostbite to torment their victims, and other evil beings obsessed with inflicting pain through the perfect preservation of cold. They roam the Shadow Planes' frozen reaches seeking to further their craft. Most serve Inkariax, the kyton demagogue known as the White Death, who seeks to preserve the fleetingness of perfection with his icy-fingered grasp. Indeed, the demagogue's favored servants almost entirely consist of libitinariis.  Other libitinariis serve Doloras, the demigoddess of dispassion, detachment, and pain, who many kytons believe was the infernal patroness that released their  kind from Hell eons ago. In some cases, libitinariis pay homage to both unholy deities, for the two churches share more in common than not. Certainly Inkariax and his worshippers pay homage to the fell queen, and so many libitinariis consider deference to her a matter of course.  Libitinariis' bodies seem humanoid, though their skin ranges in color from powder to navy blue. Their lips, ears, fingers, and toes are deep black, as if horribly frostbitten. Libitinariis often wear robes of draping chains, though most prominent on their persons are the horrific icicles that pierce their flesh. Although they are as adept at wielding traditional weapons as any humanoid, they typically favor using these icicles as thrown weapons.  Libitinariis are roughly 5 feet tall and typically weight from 90 to 140 pounds.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p> According to infernal lore, libitinariis sprang fully formed from the frozen reaches of the Shadow Plane the moment that Doloras freed the rest of their kind from Hell. Not all kytons or scholars agree on the impetus of this creation story-some believe that a frozen tear fell from Doloras's crown upon her shattering of the kytons' prison, reverberating throughout the planes to create these new servants to enact an aspect of her will. Regardless, libitinariis have since spread throughout the Shadow Plane, Hell, the Material Plane, the Dark Tapestry, and other locales to enact their vision of perfection through painful, frozen preservation.  Libitinariis are farsighted, dispassionate, and coldly rational. Many live in the realm of Frozen Tears, where they may spend centuries simply formulating a plan to please the White Death and advance their standing in his unholy court by a mere inch. Other libitinariis attempt to carve out small niches in the frozen wastes of Cocytus in Hell. Those libitinarii who call the Material Plane home typically do so as leaders of cults of Doloras or Inkariax. Some, however, hide in plain sight among society, masquerading as normal-if unsavory- scholars and artisans while secretly working to torment, freeze, and preserve their enemies as fantastic trophies to their own wicked ingenuity.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Libitinariis are relatively solitary, but regardless of where they operate, they are ritual-minded creatures. Most enjoy tormenting victims to the brink of death with their razor-sharp icicles several times before finally using their supernatural abilities to freeze the creatures permanently. Some work profane religious aspects into these rituals of torment, and others seek specifically to secure frozen prizes  for the glory of their patrons. If the libitinariis have a weak point, it might be considered their predictability in pursuing habits cultivated over decades or centuries.  An infamous libitinarii ritual is the Rite of Piercing, which is common practice in the realm of Frozen Tears. In this ritual, libitinariis drive foot-long nails of ice through the flesh of victims they have determined to be morally pure. When the victims reach the point of death, the kytons then freeze them into i</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Return_of_the_Runelords.jpg","_id":"otxVuBgWaSMnkpWi"}

Whenever a hishandura makes a full attack against an object or a structure, its attacks deal double damage.  </p><p><strong>Punitive Penance (Su)</strong> When a hishandura rends a target, that creature must succeed at a DC 25 Will save or experience overwhelming grief for its past actions, as per <i>terrible remorse</i> (Pathfinder <i>RPG Ultimate Magic</i> 243). The save DC is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Repentant Rain (Su)</strong> Once per round after confirming a critical hit with a melee weapon, a hishandura can spray gore from the wound in a 30-foot cone originating from any square occupied by its target. Each non-asura in the area is blinded for 1d3 rounds unless it succeeds at a DC 26 Reflex save. A blinded creature can wipe the gore from its eyes as a standard action, removing the blindness; alternatively, another creature adjacent to a blinded creature can wipe away the gore as a standard action. Jumping into a body of water or being subject to an effect that creates a lot of water (such as <i>create water</i> or <i>hydraulic</i> pushAPG) also removes the blindness. The save DC is Strength-based.  </p><p><strong>Scent of Carnage (Ex)</strong> A hishandura's sense of smell is especially sensitive to blood and fresh injuries. The asura gains blindsense with a range of 60 feet but can sense only corpses, badly wounded creatures (those with half their total hit points or fewer), those suffering from bleed damage, and those affected by the asura's repentant rain ability.  </p><p><strong>Smoke Sight (Ex)</strong> A hishandura can see through fire, fog, and smoke as if they were perfectly clear, ignoring the miss chance for these obstructions, up to its normal range of its vision.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Ages ago, a short-sighted god sought to punish his flock for a perceived slight, infusing a champion with a fragment of his power and sending it to wreak havoc. The champion did as commanded, tearing apart the faithful and showering their city with blood. The deity heard the tearful cries of the mortals, pleading for mercy and insisting that any kindly god would never visit such hatred upon his people. The god felt an upwelling of shame for having engineered such violence, but rather than accept responsibility or undo the damage, the god appeared before the city and forsook the divine champion, insisting that it was a raving beast sent by some less caring patron than himself. Empowered by their lying god's words and magic, the people praised him, rallied, and killed the champion. From this act of betrayal-and the remains of the slaughtered champion-rose the first hishandura.  Hishanduras are 13 feet tall and weigh 1,800 pounds.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p> Hishanduras most often originate from petitioners and lesser asuras convinced that the gods never rewarded them for their loyal service. Channeling their frustration into violence, these wronged souls ascend through reincarnation to become hishanduras.  A hishandura's body hums with destructive passion. This reflection of the original hishandura's divine mandate drives these asuras to slaughter living creatures, destroy beautiful works, and listen for the piteous cries for mercy from the fearful and faithful alike. Hishanduras can see effortlessly through the smoke of burning buildings, locate the cowering weak and wounded, and extract hateful revelations from the bloody precipitation flung by their blades. They can bypass nearly any defense to inflict their malign punishments, effortlessly teleporting past guards and discorporating to slip through portcullises.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Of all asuras, hishanduras are among the most likely to lash out at strangers or purposefully prey on mortals. Despite this violence, they harbor a remarkable sympathy for divine avengers and scapegoats, considering every relationship between a mortal and the divine a tragedy waiting to happen.  A hishandura's camaraderie is especially strong with the divine engines of destruction known as behemoths (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 3</i> 36). Behemoths and hishanduras rarely attack one another. Instead, hishanduras delight in finding signs of dormant behemoths, waking them, and reveling in the resulting destruction. The longer the beast has slumbered, the more suggestible it seems to be to the asuras' insistence that the behemoth has been forgotten or betrayed, as though being abandoned by the gods for so long makes the behemoths bitter.  Unlike other asuras, hishanduras rarely remain in the same place for long. They become restless when lingering in a site they have demolished or despoiled and are quick to move on and seek out a new target. This is only partially due to impatience, as hishanduras also dislike having to face holy champions seeking retaliation for their despoliation. It isn't the threat of defeat that irritates the hishanduras, but rather the possibility that some paladin might appear to vindicate her blind obedience to her god by killing the fiend.  Hishanduras distrust any beings placed above others, and distance themselves from asura ranas, whom they see as hypocrites. Hishanduras who honor asura ranas do so because they see truths in their violent teachings, not because they consider the ranas as lords to be slavishly obeyed. These hishanduras favor violent and vindictive patrons such as Chugarra, the Guru of Butchers; Chupurvagasti, Lady of Poison Mist; and Zurapadyn, the Beast Who Waits in Smoke.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Return_of_the_Runelords.jpg","_id":"qlSHywpXOlDIZBqq"}

When it explodes, creatures within 30 feet of it take 13d6 points of damage (Reflex DC 16 half). Half of this damage is fire and half is piercing. The save DC is Constitution-based.  </p><p><strong>Loyal Servant (Su)</strong> The Spellcraft DC to wrest or maintain control of an Ardoc moilant using <i>control construct</i> or similar magic is increased by 10 for anyone other than the moilant's master. Whenever an attempt to wrest control of the moilant fails, the moilant gains 10 temporary hit points for 1 hour, to a maximum of 30 temporary hit points.  </p><p><strong>Resounding Burst (Su)</strong> Once every 1d4 rounds as a full-round action, an Ardoc moilant can snap its vise-pincers closed  with enough force to produce a shock wave of sound and disruptive magic in a 30-foot radius centered on itself. The moilant attempts a single bull rush combat maneuver check and applies the result to each creature in the affected area. A creature pushed by the shock wave takes 2d6 points of sonic damage for every 5 feet it is pushed. In addition, the wave dispels magic in the area as per <i>greater dispel magic</i> (CL 13th). An Ardoc moilant cannot use this ability if it is grappling a creature with its vise-pincers.  </p><p><strong>Shovelhead (Ex)</strong> The serrated edge of an Ardoc moilant's shovel-like head is viciously sharp. It applies 1-1/2 times its Strength modifier to damage dealt by its gore attack, and it threatens a critical hit on a 19-20. As a full-round action, an Ardoc moilant can use its head to excavate and <i>move earth</i>, dust, or sand up to the size of a 5-foot cube (as per the spell <i>expeditious</i> excavationAPG).  </p><p><strong>Stable Footing (Ex)</strong> The weight and sturdiness of its form grants an Ardoc moilant a +2 racial bonus to its CMD versus bull rush and reposition combat maneuver checks.  </p><p><strong>Thaumaturgical Field (Su)</strong> An Ardoc moilant's spell resistance is powerful but fragile. If a spell of at least 3rd level fails to penetrate the moilant's spell resistance, it loses its spell resistance for 1d4 rounds.  </p><p><strong>Vise-Pincers (Ex)</strong> An Ardoc moilant's vise-pincers are primary natural attacks that deal bludgeoning and piercing damage. Attacks that the moilant makes with its vise-pincers ignore the hardness of objects with a hardness of 15 or less. When an Ardoc moilant successfully establishes or maintains a pin, it applies its constrict damage to both the target and the target's armor or shield (Ardoc moilant's choice).</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Ardoc moilants are hulking thaumaturgical workhorses created to <i>move earth</i> or perform other heavy labor. Efficient and powerful in their movements, Ardoc moilants carry out instructions with determination and a keen awareness that betrays a higher intelligence. The Ardoc family of Kaer Maga has achieved great success by mass-producing these constructs, which sell quickly due to their adaptability, durability, and ability to work for long periods with little need for oversight.  Ardoc moilants are roughly humanoid in shape, with strong arms that end in massive gripping pincers. Moilants have large, shovel-shaped heads that they can lower to push aside dirt and stone. Of course, these tools that make the moilants so suited for heavy labor can also be used to make devastating attacks against those who interfere with their tasks.  An Ardoc moilant is 25 feet tall and weighs 10 tons.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p> Every component of an Ardoc moilant's form is designed for labor, from its low, squat shape with wide feet to prevent destruction of valuable terrain, to its rune-  engraved pincers that can both bore through stone and lift delicate cargo. Although not built with combat as a primary function, Ardoc moilants can be used in battle with no additional modification. They are sometimes employed as secondary enforcers or guards to watch over valuable mines, factories, or palaces under construction. An Ardoc moilant's impressive size is often sufficient to dissuade any potential threats, but persistent trespassers soon find that a moilant's gripping pincers and shovel-shaped head are formidable weapons. Although every component of an Ardoc moilant is created by or enhanced with magic, its magical nature is most apparent in its rune-carved pincers, which can create powerful magical shock waves.  Ardoc moilants are particularly clever, able to evaluate outcomes and approach assigned tasks with a keen understanding of engineering principles. One of the many secrets the Ardocs keep about the construction process is that this sophisticated programming relies on patterning from a human soul. Though this patterning is vital to the moilants' utility and popularity, the patterning ritual is exceptionally painful and sometimes fatal to the human source.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  As constructs built by the Ardocs' arcane masters, moilants have no society in the traditional sense-at least according to the Ardoc family. Customers have noted, however, that Ardoc moilants seem to exhibit patterns of behavior that hint at a deeper level of consciousness and an inner drive for companionship. Unless presented with constant activity, the labor-constructs tend to gather in small groups, or even with other machines or constructs. Most Ardoc moilants are created with the ability to speak a language selected by the buyer. They speak only rarely, and their deep, gravelly voices sound like metal scraping on metal. All moilants acquire distinctive personalities and notable quirks over time, such as collecting certain types of small items or pushing rubble into shapes that mimic the runes on their pincers. Diligent owners might demand a readjustment or refund from the Ardoc family when their moilants start to demonstrate too much individual initiative, but some moilants leave their masters and strike out on their own before this readjustment can occur.  <br /><strong>Construction</strong><br />  Crafting an Ardoc moilant requires 20,000 pounds of steel smelt with rare compounds costing 7,500 gp. The precise process is jealously guarded by the Ardoc family.  <br /></p><div class=\"heading\"><p class=\"alignleft\">Ardoc Moilant</p> <strong>CL</strong> 13th; <strong>Price</strong> 87,500 gp <br /><hr /><strong>Construction</strong><hr /> <strong>Requirements</strong> Craft Construct, <i>geas/quest</i>, <i>limited wish</i>, <i>make whole</i>, <i>move earth</i>, creator must be caster level 13th; <strong>Skill</strong> Craft (armor) or Craft (weapons) DC 20; <strong>Cost</strong> 47,500 gp</div></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Return_of_the_Runelords.jpg","_id":"yYSCRYbcfVwC35Tc"}

Ashava's fascinate and inspire heroics bardic performances can affect any number of creatures that can see and hear her. There is no limit to the number of rounds Ashava can use her bardic performances each day.  </p><p><strong>Hypnotize Undead (Su)</strong> Ashava can affect undead creatures with her fascinate bardic performance, despite their immunity to enchantment or mind-affecting effects, and she can command any number of undead creatures fascinated in this way as a standard action, per <i>command undead</i> (Will DC 41 negates). The save DC is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Luminescent Form (Su)</strong> As a swift action, Ashava can transform herself into pure moonlight, becoming incorporeal. Her fly speed triples in luminescent form, but she can't use any of her spell-like abilities or her moonlight javelin attack. She can return to her corporeal form as a swift action.  </p><p><strong>Lyrical Grace (Ex)</strong> Ashava gains a sacred bonus to her Armor Class and on initiative checks equal to her Charisma modifier. She can ignore any effect that would reduce her speed or prevent her from taking a 5-foot step.  </p><p><strong>Moonlight Javelin (Su)</strong> As a free action, Ashava can conjure a <i>+5 holy javelin</i> created out of solid moonlight into her hand. This weapon deals force damage, has a range increment of 100 feet, and dazzles any target it strikes for 1 month or until Ashava chooses to end a target's dazzled condition as a free action. Ashava adds her Charisma modifier to damage rolls with her moonlight javelins. A moonlight javelin vanishes once it leaves Ashava's hand (or, if thrown, it vanishes after striking or missing its target).  </p><p><strong>Primal Aura (Su)</strong> Ashava constantly shines with the light of the moon. No effect can reduce the light level in her primal aura below dim light, unless she allows it or unless the effect is created by a more powerful deity. Weapons wielded in Ashava's primal aura are treated as chaotic-aligned, good-aligned, and silver for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Long ago in the wild and lonely fens of Elysium, a collection of helpful marsh lights coalesced to form Ashava, the True Spark. Ashava is constant motion, spinning and twirling in steps that soothe all who watch her dance. Although she often remains at a distance from those who watch her, she nevertheless leads them out of wild places and back to the safety of civilization. She believes that no being-whether living or dead-should suffer the fear of being lost.  A part of Ashava lives in the hearts of all dancers, and her influence can be felt by those who rise from their seats when moved by a stirring beat or melodious chords. She believes that dance is the soul's truest form of expression, and she looks down on those who would stifle their own or others' creativity in this field. Ashava maintains that there is no wrong way to dance, and that dance not only embodies but transcends culture. She derives as much pleasure from the clumsy steps of eager but novice dancers as she does the practiced movements of professional ballerinas.  Ashava spends much of her time dancing through darkened swamps across many worlds, aiding lost travelers and fighting evil forces that would disorient and waylay them. On Elysium, Ashava's realm is the Sparkling Fens, a swamp eternally bathed in moonlight. It rests at the base of the Mountain of Lingering Soulsong, and the mountain's echoing melodies drift down into the marsh to provide Ashava and the azatas who follow her with accompaniment to their never-ending dances. No one can remain lost for very long within the Sparkling Fens, as floating globes of light-similar to will-o'-wisps in appearance but kindly in temperament-always appear to guide visitors to safety. These lights are both servants of Ashava and part of her, and she can feel and control them no matter where she is in the cosmos as if they were extensions of her own limbs.  <strong><br />ASHAVA'S FAITH</strong><br /> Ashava is the patron of dancers, lonely spirits, and moonlight. Her worshipers include many who strike out from the comfort of their homes to move through dark and unexplored spaces in order to guide others back to safety. She encourages her followers to dance whenever the mood overtakes them, and most of her holy ceremonies center around movement in one form or another. Her most sacred areas are graveyards and forest clearings, especially when those places are drenched in moonlight. Ashava's religion is particularly popular along Varisia's Lost Coast.  Ashava's faith is not just about joyous dancing, however. The recently bereaved also pray to the True Spark in her aspect as a shepherd of lost souls. Psychopomps ensure that the dead make their way along the River of Souls to their appointed rewards in the afterlife, but Ashava (and  many of her followers) aid wandering spirits who have strayed from that path and need help returning to it. Ashavic dancers are followers of Ashava who specialize in this task, using the power of dance and moonlight to create magical effects that can exorcise possessing spirits and even unravel the necromantic energies that empower the undead. This prestige class is detailed on page 4 of <i>Pathfinder Player Companion</i>: <i>Paths of the Righteous</i>.  Ashava's holy symbol is a silhouette of a dancing woman against a full moon. Her favored weapon is the bladed scarf (<i>Pathfinder Campaign Setting</i>: <i>Inner Sea World Guide</i> 291) and her sacred animal is the wolf. She grants access to the domains of Chaos, Darkness, Good, and Repose, and access to the subdomains of Ancestors, Azata, MoonBOTD, and RevelryBOTD. More information about Ashava and her faith is presented starting on page 68.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Return_of_the_Runelords.jpg","_id":"zBzAqbb3ELS8Izfc"}
