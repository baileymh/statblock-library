Though not truly invisible, they are hard to pinpoint. While using this ability, an observer robot gains a +8 racial bonus on Stealth checks and has concealment from creatures more than 5 feet away.  </p><p><strong>Integrated Laser Torch (Ex)</strong> An observer robot is outfitted with an integrated laser torch used to bypass barriers or restraints. When activated, the torch emits a beam of highly focused light, cutting and burning through surfaces up to 6 inches away. Attacks from a laser torch resolve as touch attacks and deal 1d10 points of fire damage. This damage is not modified further by Strength. An observer robot's integrated laser torch is mounted on an extending arm that allows it greater reach. When the laser torch is used as a tool or as a weapon to sunder, its damage bypasses hardness up to 20 points, and damage is not halved (as is normally the case for energy damage applied to objects) unless the object is particularly fire-resistant. A laser torch's cutting beam passes through force fields and force effects without damaging the field. Invisible objects and creatures can't be harmed by a laser torch.  </p><p><strong>Integrated Stun Gun (Ex)</strong> An observer robot has an integrated stun gun built into its head. This weapon uses a sonic amplifier to produce powerful low-frequency blasts of energy that can pummel targets. This weapon has a range increment of 20 feet, and it deals 1d8 points of nonlethal damage. When it scores a critical hit, the robot can attempt a free trip combat maneuver (CMB +13) against the target, which does not provoke attacks of opportunity.  </p><p><strong>Transmit Senses (Ex)</strong> An observer robot is outfitted with a number of sensors, cameras, and microphones that allow it to record events and transmit them to another location. An observer robot can record up to 12 hours of audio and video. An observer robot's communications can be keyed to a commsetTG or other similar device, and it can broadcast everything it can see or hear to this device as long as it is within 1 mile. The signal strength can be enhanced with a signal boosterTG. An observer robot can also transmit its senses to another observer robot. A signal has difficulty penetrating solid barriers. A signal is blocked by 1 foot of metal, 5 feet of stone, or 20 feet of organic matter. Force fields do not block signals. Broadcasting functions like a <i>scrying</i> sensor, allowing the viewer to hear and see what the observer robot is experiencing. The viewer gains the benefits of any nonmagical special abilities the observer robot has tied to its senses (such as low-light vision), but the viewer uses her own Perception skill. This ability doesn't allow magically or supernaturally enhanced senses to work through it, even if both the observer robot and the viewer possess them.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Designed for reconnaissance, observer robots are deployed to serve as the eyes and ears of their controllers. Because they're intelligent and able to make their own decisions, observer robots are suited for exploring without supervision, recording their observations so that they can relay the images and sounds to their creators. The outer hull of an observer robot and its wings are covered in a network of tiny screens that can display images of the robots' surroundings, which grants the observer robot a form of camouf lage that allows it to clandestinely observe its subjects.  The statistics above represent the most common observer robots, but some models have enhanced senses that allow them to see in darkness or see invisible creatures. Some even have olfactory sensors that effectively smell their environment and test the surrounding air for impurities that would harm their creators. Observer robots deployed in hostile environments might be outfitted with more formidable weaponry than the standard stun gun and laser torch.  An observer robot is approximately 20 inches long and weighs 8 pounds.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Iron_Gods.jpg","_id":"1PEFYIEDIr3MwuX1"}

All damage dealt to an evaluator robot with an active force field is deducted from these hit points first. As long as the force field is active, the evaluator robot is immune to critical hits. An evaluator robot's force field has fast healing 10, but once these hit points are reduced to 0, the force field shuts down and does not reactivate for 24 hours.  </p><p><strong>Integrated Laser Rifle (Ex)</strong> An evaluator robot has a built-in laser rifle. This weapon has a range of 150 feet and deals 4d6 points of fire damage on a hit. The weapon can fire once per round as a ranged touch attack. A laser attack can pass through force fields and force effects, such as a <i>wall of force</i>, to strike a foe beyond without damaging that field. Objects like glass or other transparent barriers don't provide cover from lasers, but unlike force barriers, a transparent physical barrier still takes damage when a laser passes through it. Invisible creatures and objects are immune to damage from lasers. Fog, smoke, and other  clouds provide cover in addition to concealment from laser attacks. Darkness (magical or otherwise) has no effect on lasers other than providing concealment.  </p><p><strong>Memory Wipe (Ex)</strong> As a standard action, an evaluator robot can make a touch attack that, if it hits, injects nanites into a target and erases the last 12 hours of its memories. A successful DC 19 Will save negates this effect. This is a mind-affecting effect, and the save DC is Intelligence-based.  </p><p><strong>Process Languages (Ex)</strong> Exceptional processing and data stores allows an evaluator robot to parse language in a way that lets it permanently speak and understand any spoken or written language it observes for at least 1 minute.  </p><p><strong>Stun (Ex)</strong> An evaluator robot's melee attacks deliver a nonlethal jolt of electricity with each strike. If the robot strikes a creature twice in one round with its bastard sword or slam attack, that target must succeed at a DC 19 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Intelligence-based.  </p><p><strong>Superior Optics (Ex)</strong> An evaluator robot can see invisible creatures or objects as if they were visible.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Androffans, the race responsible for the presence of robots on Golarion, were a spacefaring people who visited dozens of worlds. Masters of engineering, they created robots that could perform a wide array of tasks, even trusting their creations to perform complex surgeries on the Androffans' own organic forms. In the course of their interplanetary explorations, the Androffans quickly learned that not every world was ready to comprehend the awesome experience of leaving one's home planet to visit others. Not wanting to risk valuable crew members, the Androffans created evaluator robots as an alternative to sending a shuttle mission to alien planets and interacting in person. When sensors aboard Androffan ships orbiting foreign worlds discovered other humanoid species, evaluator robots would be dispatched to assess the planets' alien cultures.  Taking forms designed to be recognizable to a planet's general populace, evaluator robots would drop from orbiting surveillance ships onto alien worlds to collect data so that their masters could determine the readiness of the planets' inhabitants to accept the existence of creatures from other worlds. Androffans also used evaluator robots to determine how violent or superstitious the indigenous populations were so that they could carefully plan direct contact. Evaluator robots were fashioned into pleasing and majestic forms to command respect and admiration from the humanoids they interacted with, and were usually made slightly taller than the planet's primary race so as to seem properly impressive. These robots' advanced construction utilizes sophisticated lightweight materials, making their durable frames weigh in under 400 pounds. The model presented here is the most common design-a radiant humanoid angel with gleaming feathers of brushed metal.    <br /><strong>Design</strong><br />  The engineers who designed evaluator robots created each one to serve specific purposes tailored to the world it was intended to observe. These thematic designs were tested through trial and error by the evaluators themselves, who paid close attention to the religions encountered on each planet. They discovered that reverence for angelic beings was common on many worlds populated by sentient humanoids, so the engineers built the majority of evaluator robots in this form.  Although some evaluators were designed for use on worlds that used advanced technology, evaluators were rarely used to observe cultures that had already reached space on their own or that were otherwise accustomed to dealing with beings from other worlds. In some cases, Androffan engineers designed evaluator robots to mimic the form of beings iconic to the populace, gathering information about these individuals from intercepted communication signals. This was often judged too risky, however, as it was found that cultures rarely responded well to the eventual revelation that their resurrected heroes and messiahs were actually alien robots.  Even though redesigning an evaluator robot's outward form was simple, their complex programming required a vast amount of collected data. If the robot couldn't reply in a convincing manner, or if its memory-modifying nanites took no hold on the alien humanoids it encountered, then the evaluator's mission was quickly compromised. The robot's creators then had to hope that the interaction would be interpreted as a fluke supernatural experience, or that the witness would be disbelieved and derided by its community.  Evaluator robots are universally curious, their programming filling them with an endless need to learn about living creatures. These robots take every opportunity to ask questions of intelligent organic life forms, especially humanoids. An evaluator robot compares these answers to profiles of existing cultures, either installed when it was created or assembled from previous interactions. Complex algorithms capable of parsing the nuances of myriad humanoid societies allow the robot to quickly evaluate and categorize the nature of a particular society using these hundreds or thousands of profiles. Once an evaluator has thoroughly assessed a planet's cultures, its Androffan masters use this information to plan a landing expedition to make direct contact.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  As robots, evaluators have no society outside of their programming, and their habitat is wherever they happen to be deployed. In the Inner Sea region, nearly all evaluator robots encountered to date have been found in Silver Mount.  Since they were designed to interact with sentient organic beings, evaluator robots don't regularly associate with  other robots unless tasked with a project requiring such interaction, and instead keep the company of humanoids (though their cold robotic presence isn't always comforting).  Crafts that split from <i>Divinity</i> during its crash and fell to other parts of Numeria contained two other known evaluator robots. A tribe of Ghost Wolves destroyed one of these evaluators-designed to resemble a horned, red-skinned fiend-when it appeared before the Kellid barbarians in the Sellen Hills. The robot fought with wicked claws, and after it was destroyed, it exploded in a blast that killed dozens of the barbarians. The other evaluator, reportedly appearing as a six-armed, three-faced woman with bronze skin, was spotted brief ly by griffon riders at Castle Urion before it headed south into the River Kingdoms, and hasn't been seen since.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Iron_Gods.jpg","_id":"2wUOP44xt4pT6yDe"}

The rust-risen presented here has the arm drill and metal jaw augmentations. See the next page for other augmentations.  </p><p><strong>Malfunction (Ex)</strong> The machinery embedded in a rust-risen functions unpredictably in stressful situations. When a rust-risen enters combat, there is a cumulative 1% chance each round that it malfunctions. This chance resets to 0% 1 minute after combat ends.

These hideous undead mockeries riddled with the remnants of ancient technology-rotting creatures, outfitted with twitching relics of a space-faring race, that prey on the living by tearing their victims to shreds with gnashing drills, vivisecting scalpels, and flailing exsanguination tubes.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Necromancers with a twisted affinity for technology often forgo the usual ghoul or   zombie minions for a rust-risen ally. Far from mindless, rust-risen possess limited memories of their lives before undeath, though these recollections are more like misshapen shadows flickering on the walls of their minds, and are often distorted and highly inaccurate.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Rust-risen possess the unnatural hunger for the living shared by other undead, but they also maintain a strange obsession with technological artifacts. It's not uncommon when breaching a rust-risen lair to find it filled with baubles, gizmos, and other technological oddities-even schematics which rust-risen cannot make sense of. Rust-risen collect such items, which appear to give them some semblance of comfort in their rotting horror of an existence. Rust-risen also seek sources of electrical power, finding them comforting in the same way a warm bath soothes living flesh. If denied access to an electrical power source, rust-risen become sluggish and despondent, but spring to activity as soon as they are exposed to electricity.  Rust-risen are always bonded to their creator, serving them as loyally as an animal companion does its master. They rely on their creator to keep their malfunctioning technology from completely breaking down. Over time however, their bond grows into obsession; eventually it becomes an uncontrollable desire for their master to join them in undeath. Such obsessed rust-risen often overpower their necromancer overlords, who awaken to find themselves on an operating table, their machine-studded monstrosities hovering busily over their extracted viscera.  If a rust-risen's creator is destroyed, the undead becomes despondent and lost. It wanders, avoiding civilization and hovering at the fringes of communities, preying on stragglers and wallowing in misanthropic misery. At the same time, it constantly seeks the aid of anyone who can keep it from breaking down. This duality means that the mood of an uncontrolled rust-risen is nigh-impossible to predict.  <br /><strong>Rust-Risen Augmentations</strong><br /> As rust-risen are cobbled together from dead bodies augmented with barely-functioning machinery, no two are exactly alike. Some technologically minded necromancers with enough raw materials and a consistent design plan try to make their rust-risen conform to a template, but most packs of rust-risen are motley and violent amalgamations of flesh and steel.  A GM can further modify rust-risen in their games with augmentations of their own creation, but they should be no more powerful than those described below.  <br /><i>Additional Appendage</i>: Some rust-risen are augmented with an additional mechanical limb. A rust-risen with this augmentation gains a slam attack that deals damage appropriate for its size (1d4 for most rust-risen). This arm   can manipulate objects as well as a normal arm, but cannot be used to wield a weapon.  <br /><i>Antifreeze</i>: A rust-risen with this augmentation has an embedded series of tubes connected to a pump that keeps a chemical flowing through its body, preventing ice from forming inside it. The rust-risen gains resistance 5 to cold.  <br /><i>Arm Drill</i>: A rust-risen with this augmentation has a deadly, spinning drill grafted onto its forearm. The rust-risen can use the drill to make a melee attack that deals 1d6 points of bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.  <br /><i>Cling Hooks</i>: A rust-risen with this augmentation has barbed hooks grafted into its arms and legs. The rust-risen gains a +4 racial bonus on Climb checks and a +4 racial bonus on combat maneuvers to grapple opponents.  <br /><i>Cutting Arm</i>: A rust-risen with this augmentation has one of its forearms replaced with a functional laser torch. The rust-risen deals 1d10 points of fire damage as a touch attack. This damage is not modified further by Strength. When the laser torch is used as a tool or as a weapon to sunder, damage dealt by it bypasses hardness up to 20 points and isn't halved (as is normally the case for energy damage applied to objects) unless the object is fire resistant. A laser torch's cutting beam passes through a force field and force effect without damaging that field. Invisible objects and creatures cannot be harmed by a laser torch.  <br /><i>Eviscerator</i>: A rust-risen with the eviscerator augmentation has a number of twisting blades, reciprocating saws, and spinning drills built into its chest. The rust-risen deals an additional 1d8 points of damage when grappling.  <br /><i>Exsanguination Tubes</i>: A rust-risen with exsanguination tubes can drain blood from creatures it has grappled. If the rust-risen establishes or maintains a pin, it bleeds the target, dealing 1 point of Constitution damage.  <br /><i>Metal Jaw</i>: A rust-risen with this augmentation has a metal jaw replacing its natural one. The rust-risen gains a bite attack that deals damage appropriate for its size (1d6 points of damage for most rust-risen).  <br /><i>Multi-tool</i>: A rust-risen with this augmentation has at least one of its hands replaced with a variety of tools. The rust-risen gains a +4 competence bonus on Disable Device checks and is considered to be trained in that skill. The rust-risen also gains a +2 competence bonus on one specific Craft skill.  <br /><i>Steel Clad</i>: A rust-risen with this augmentation has sheets of metal riveted to is body. The rust-risen gains a +2 natural armor bonus.  <br /><i>Tripod</i>: A rust-risen with this augmentation has an additional mechanical leg. The rust-risen gains a +2 bonus to CMD against overrun and trip attempts and a +2 bonus on Acrobatics when moving on narrow surfaces or uneven ground. The rust-risen isn't considered flat-footed nor does it lose its Dexterity bonus to AC when using Acrobatics in this way.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Iron_Gods.jpg","_id":"3hKP31MPcCOZg1Bd"}

They are aggressive and often attack creatures that are larger than themselves. Pilos plow toward their foes and attempt to gore these foes with their spikes, bellowing a wheezing series of grunts. When provoked by a creature much larger than themselves or a particularly dangerous predator, pilos roll up into a spiny ball to deter attacks. Their aggressive nature means that they often fight until they die or until their opponent perishes or flees. Though pilos are only 3 feet long, their muscular bodies and spikes-which constantly grow-contribute to their 80-pound weight. Like many marsupials, pilos carry their young in a pouch, which they protect by remaining rolled up except when hunting.  <br /><strong>Pilo Companions</strong><br />  <strong>Starting Statistics</strong>: <strong>Size</strong> Small; <strong>Speed</strong> 30 ft.; <strong>AC</strong> +2 natural armor; <strong>Attack</strong> gore (1d6); <strong>Ability Scores</strong> Str 13, Dex 13, Con 14, Int 2, Wis 14, Cha 7; <strong>Special</strong> <strong>Defenses</strong> roll up; <strong>SQ</strong> low-light vision, scent.  <strong>4th-level Advancement</strong>: <strong>Size</strong> Small; <strong>AC</strong> +2 natural armor; <strong>Attack</strong> tail slap (1d4); <strong>Ability Scores</strong> Str +2, Con +2; <strong><strong>Special</strong> <strong>Attack</strong>s</strong> poison, quills.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Iron_Gods.jpg","_id":"51GpJ1QlZK26MM0o"}

All damage dealt to the robot is deducted from these hit points first. As long as the force field is active, the myrmidon is immune to critical hits. This force field has fast healing 12, but once its hit points are reduced to 0, the force field shuts down and doesn't reactivate for 24 hours.  </p><p><strong>Integrated Laser Rifle (Ex)</strong> A myrmidon's eye is an integrated laser rifleTG. It cannot make iterative attacks with this weapon. The laser rifle can be targeted by effects that target manufactured weapons (such as sunder attempts). It doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity when used in melee combat (and cannot be harvested for use outside of the robot's body).  </p><p><strong>Quantum Lash (Ex)</strong> The robot's two facial tentacles are primary melee attacks with a reach of 20 feet. They deal force damage; this damage is not modified by Strength and cannot be improved via Power Attack. A quantum lash that strikes a force effect has a chance to disrupt the effect. Against a magical force effect (such as a <i>wall of</i> force), the myrmidon attempts a special caster level check (with a bonus of +11) as if it were casting <i>dispel magic</i> against the effect. Against a robot's force field or a force effect granted by a technological item, the creature struck can resist having the force effect negated with a successful DC 20 Fortitude save-failure indicates that the force effect is negated for 1d10 rounds. If a robot's force field is suppressed in this way, it returns with the same number of hit points it had when it was deactivated. The save DC is Intelligence-based.  </p><p><strong>Resilient (Ex)</strong> Myrmidon robots receive a +3 racial bonus on all saving throws.   </p><p><strong>Rockets (Ex)</strong> As a standard action, a myrmidon can fire a rocket to a range of 800 feet. A rocket explodes on impact in a 30-foot-radius burst, dealing 6d6 points of bludgeoning damage to all creatures in the area (Reflex DC 20 half). The robot carries a maximum of five rockets at any one time, and can replenish fired rockets at a rate of one per 12 hours, crafting new rockets from scrap metal and other collected components. The save DC is Intelligence-based.  </p><p><strong>Superior Optics (Ex)</strong> A myrmidon robot sees invisible creatures or objects as if they were visible.</p></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Iron_Gods.jpg","_id":"7Hz6J4SPZTHLHyvN"}

Given a massive insectile form to allow it to perform all of its necessary functions, Latten Mechanism's only humanlike feature is the androgynous face built into the top of its insectile head. Able to tear open castle gates, create iron walls, scoop up enemies and crush them in its body, reshape the very earth it stands on, and form complex objects out of raw materials or thin air, Latten Mechanism is a versatile engine of creation and destruction guided by a mechanical conscience that values constructs as much as it does intelligent living creatures.  The herald sees itself as a protective parent of all constructs, especially intelligent ones, and never uses its powers to destroy artificial beings unless it has no other choice; it prefers to neutralize or sideline these opponents until it has the opportunity to reprogram or repurpose them. Much as a true champion of freedom loathes charm spells for temporarily enslaving a person's free will, Latten Mechanism believes spells such as <i>control construct</i> are a violation of a sentient construct's free will, and only uses them as a last resort to peacefully end a threat. When confronted by a dangerous construct in an enemy's service, Latten Mechanism has been known to render the construct helpless and flee with it, returning to deal with the construct's master at a later time. The herald is a legend among intelligent constructs, and many come to Brigh's faith after witnessing or experiencing its generosity and leniency.  The herald doesn't speak in battle, as it prefers to fool its opponents into mistaking it for a mindless clockwork foe. Outside of combat, it's curious about its allies' inventions  and crafting projects, and it can provide many insights into how the ally might overcome various obstacles to achieve greater successes (although it sometimes needs a few minutes to update its mind with knowledge suitable for the conversation). It can speak equally well out of its termite or humanoid mouth, and sometimes uses both in the same conversation, adding deep emphasis to certain words with its inhuman vocal apparatus. Both voices have a metallic, echoing twang.  The herald's proper name is Latten Mechanism, although it answers to either part of its name individually, or even if its name is used as a title (\"the Latten Mechanism\"). Its programming allows it to recognize flattery, insults, and threats, although it doesn't really understand the motivations for such things. The easiest way to anger it is to treat it like an unfeeling, unthinking machine or suggest that it could be parceled into useful parts (in the same way that a dragon would object to a casual discussion of how its hide could be made into armor).  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Latten Mechanism is a created being that has no need to eat or drink. Though it has a need for occasional maintenance to prevent its delicate mechanical parts from seizing up or breaking down, it's effectively immortal. It has no need to reproduce, but it treats all constructs it builds (even the temporary ones) as beloved pets, and is saddened if they are damaged, destroyed, or otherwise compromised. It feels kinship toward mortals who create constructs, so long as those creators are respectful toward their inventions.  The herald has no particular attachment to any mortal race or country, although it has spent more time among humans and the people of Alkenstar than any other kind or place. It holds neither aversion nor affinity to undead creatures-it considers reusing dead body parts to create   new entities essentially similar to reusing metal or wood from a destroyed construct to repair or build another.  Because it became self-aware only when Brigh built it out of inanimate parts, it has no fear of death-for it, death is the same as the state of non-consciousness it existed in before its activation. If it was destroyed, but Brigh needed its abilities once more, the goddess would recreate and reawaken it; from the herald's perspective, this wouldn't even be an interruption of its consciousness.  Latten Mechanism has a fondness for small clockwork objects and wind-up toys, such as rolling carts, hopping animals, and music boxes. It collects these treasures much the way noble's child might collect elaborate dolls. A priest who offers such a thing as part of a payment when the herald is called is likely to gain the herald's support, especially if the device features a clever mechanism, such as a dragon toy that utilizes a smokestick to create a miniature breath weapon, or a mechanical spider that utilizes a tanglefoot bag to catch bugs with tiny bursts of sticky webbing.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  The herald spends most of its time on Axis mixing with Brigh's other servitors and pursuing its own research projects. It enjoys the company of axiomites and inevitables, respecting their non-biological anatomies and ever curious about their devotion to law. It sometimes directly intervenes in the mortal world by soothing a rampaging construct that might accidentally kill a genius inventor, but otherwise limits its interactions to those commanded by Brigh.  Among the servitors of Brigh, Latten Mechanism is admired for its crafting skills and devotion to all artificial creatures. Some servitors who become melancholy and long to become true flesh beings seek counsel from the herald, hoping to gain a better appreciation of their mechanical bodies and the uniqueness of their souls.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Iron_Gods.jpg","_id":"AsRtmZY3GY6XmclH"}

This bypasses any active force fields or similar effects, but doesn't harm other living creatures or the director robot. Any technological item within this radius is drained of 1d6 charges unless it succeeds at a DC 20 Reflex save. The save DCs are Intelligence-based.  </p><p><strong>Grasping Tentacles (Ex)</strong> A director robot's tentacles are primary attacks and have the grab special ability.  </p><p><strong>Integrated Laser Rifle (Ex)</strong> A director robot has a built-in laser rifle. This weapon has a range of 150 feet and deals 2d6 points of fire damage on a hit. The weapon can fire once per round as a ranged touch attack. A laser attack can pass through force fields and force effects, such as a <i>wall of force</i>, to strike a foe beyond without damaging that field. Objects like glass or other transparent barriers don't provide cover from lasers, but unlike force barriers, a transparent physical barrier still takes damage when a laser passes through it. Invisible creatures and objects are immune to damage from lasers. Fog, smoke, and other clouds provide cover  in addition to concealment from laser attacks. Darkness (magical or otherwise) has no effect on lasers other than providing concealment.  </p><p><strong>Override (Ex)</strong> A director robot can usurp control of an otherwise functional robot. In order to gain control of a robot, the director robot must first make a ranged touch attack against a target robot within a range of 60 feet. If the attack is successful, the targeted robot must succeed at a DC 20 Will saving throw to prevent the director robot from linking to the target's command processor. On any subsequent turn after a link is established, the director robot can issue a command to the targeted robot as a standard action. The targeted robot can attempt another Will save (DC 20) to resist following each command.  To command its target, the director robot must be within 60 feet of the targeted robot and must issue the command in a language the robot understands. The types of commands it can issue are similar to those allowed by a <i>suggestion</i> spell-once a command is successfully issued, the robot does its best to carry out the orders over the course of the next hour. Additionally, any robot affected by this ability also gains a +2 competence bonus on attack and weapon damage rolls. These save DCs are Intelligence-based.  </p><p><strong>Repair Robot (Ex)</strong> As a standard action that doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity, a director robot can repair damage done to either itself or an adjacent creature with the robot subtype, healing the target for 1d10 points of damage.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>No society endures without order, and among robots that order is enforced by directors. Clad in gleaming metal and viewing the world through a rotating array of lenses, a director is a robotic overseer designed to maximize efficiency and command the loyalty of lesser automatons. Its torso rests upon a utilitarian egg-shaped pod loaded with manipulators, tools, and dozens of thin mechanical tendrils. Four long, mechanical legs support its bulk and carry it across any terrain, even allowing the robot to cling magnetically to vertical surfaces. While the upper frame sports human-like arms to manipulate traditional tools and weapons, two powerful tentacles extend from below its frame to facilitate combat and handle heavy lifting. Though its humanoid torso is barely larger than that of a human, the director's entire frame stands over 10 feet tall and weighs nearly half a ton.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Directors are middle managers built to ensure efficiency, productivity, and obedience. They oversee complex projects and protect networks of robots from outside corruption. A unit of robots controlled by a director goes about its business swiftly and with mechanical precision, taking what organic beings might mistake for pride in conserving resources or completing projects rapidly.    Naturally, director robots need neither rest nor food, and their internal generators provide nearly limitless power. Designed to be adaptable, they function with equal ease on the battlef ield, within winding corridors, deep underwater, and upon starship hulls in the vacuum of space. The magnetic claws that carry the director's bulk up sheer surfaces with surprising speed and grace are also perfectly suited to dragging damaged robots from the field.  To better analyze and respond to threats, directors are programmed with a remarkably advanced artif icial intelligence, capable of limited self-awareness and interaction with others. Their sophisticated systems easily overwhelm and seize control of other computer-operated devices, dredging memories and secrets from robotic minds, setting them to whatever work the director prioritizes, and removing any corrupting outside inf luence.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  A director robot's role is to break down the high-level goals of their superiors into simple instructions for lesser robots. While not fully self-aware in ways organic beings appreciate, their cold, clean minds take something like comfort in hard work, and experience distress if kept from their duties or left devoid of purpose-those without a clear goal often become obsessive, directing lesser robots to create order for its own sake. Surprisingly social, they fare poorly in isolation without other machines to interact with and direct.  Like all robots, directors are built, not born. With neural networks almost as advanced as androids', newly activated units undergo a learning period during which they reconcile their reams of programmed knowledge with the unpredictable tendencies of reality. This digital \"infancy\" is a confusing time, and these robots exhibit extreme frustration while learning to adapt. Other directors are especially wary of these child units, and keep a cautious eye sensor on them, always prepared to jump in and override the new robot if it proves incapable of translating theory into practice.  Directors rarely stray from their heavily technological environments. On Golarion, they usually cling to Silver Mount, but sometimes accompany a legion of the Technic League gearsmen unbidden, ignoring orders from human masters and watching over their mechanical charges with an almost religious devotion. Some directors operate within Starfall where they direct other robots used by the Technic League.  Tightly guarded reports held by the Technic League claim that a rogue director robot maintains a hidden lair somewhere in central Numeria. The robot has taken over a splintered section of <i>Divinity</i> that contains a technological laboratory, and the reports claim that it's building its own army of robotic followers.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Iron_Gods.jpg","_id":"BpltrnsgsE6zyOAn"}

The save DCs of these spells increase by 2 when in the presence of holographic machinery (such as in areas D8-D10). Additionally, Deacon Hope's <i>dimension door</i> spell-like ability isn't as much actual teleportation as it is merely him manifesting himself through an electrical outlet or object on the recreation deck. As such, this ability isn't impeded by the Divinity Drive, but it functions only here on the recreation deck (areas D1-D17).  </p><p><strong>Memory Consumption (Su)</strong> Deacon Hope feeds on memories and knowledge via his incorporeal touch. A creature damaged by his touch must succeed at a DC 22 Will save or take 1d4 points of Intelligence drain. For each point of Intelligence drained, Deacon Hope gains 1 memory point-a memory point fades after 1 hour if not used. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Deacon Hope can expend memory points as free actions to accomplish the following effects.  <i>Arcane Recall</i>: Deacon Hope can regain one use of a 3/day spell-like ability by expending 2 memory points, or one use per day of a 1/day spell-like ability by expending 5 memory points.  <i>Corporeal Form</i>: Deacon Hope can become corporeal for 1 round by expending 1 memory point. He loses the incorporeal trait and defense and his fly speed, but gains a speed of 30 feet and a Strength score equal to his Charisma (22).  <i>Feat Absorption</i>: As he inflicts Intelligence drain on a target, he can expend 4 memory points to gain one feat of his choice possessed by the target. This feat persists for 1 hour, during which time the target can't use that feat (this doesn't impact access to feats that use the absorbed feat as a prerequisite).  <i>Skill Absorption</i>: As Deacon Hope inflicts Intelligence drain on a target, he can expend 2 memory points to gain one skill check bonus of his choice possessed by the target-he attempts skill checks with this skill using the target's total bonus, not his own. This skill bonus persists for 1 hour, during which time the target attempts all checks with that skill as if untrained.  </p><p><strong>Vulnerable to Force Effects (Ex)</strong> Deacon Hope takes half again as much damage (+50%) from force effects that deal damage.</p></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Iron_Gods.jpg","_id":"CJmYE2DevPp7qm6X"}

This weapon uses a powerful sonic amplifier to produce powerful low-frequency blasts of energy that pummel targets. This weapon has a range increment of 20 feet, and it deals 1d8 points of nonlethal damage. On a critical hit, the robot can attempt a free trip combat maneuver (CMB +12) against the target, which does not provoke attacks of opportunity.  </p><p><strong>Integrated Tracking (Ex)</strong> A collector robot has integrated systems that allow it to tag and track creatures. As a full-round action, a collector robot can implant a tracker chipTG into the body of a target that it is grappling or a helpless target. Once implanted, the tracker chip is activated and  the collector robot's chipfinder can detect the presence of the implanted tracker chip within 1 mile. It uses a signal to locate the tracker chips, and this signal can be blocked by 1 foot of metal, 5 feet of stone, or 20 feet of organic matter. A tracker chip can be removed with a sharp tool. Doing so deals 1 point of damage. Once an implanted tracker chip is removed from the body (or remains in a body after it dies) it retains enough energy to continue to be detected by the collector robot's sensors for 1 week.  </p><p><strong>Reactive Gyros (Ex)</strong> The rotors that grant a collector robot flight also provide quick reactions to threats and external stimuli, granting it a +3 racial bonus on Reflex saves.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Serving as long-distance scouts, trackers, and acquisition agents, collector robots see frequent use in the study and collection of alien life forms on new worlds. They can operate independently for years, cataloging unique species while enduring extreme environments that would overwhelm their biological makers. These machines may tag a captive creature with a tracker chip that can be monitored and tracked with their integrated chipfinders. They do so to observe and document the behavioral patterns of such creatures from afar, studying viable specimens for days until they eventually isolate and retrieve the studied prey again for further examination in the controlled laboratories of the robots' masters.  Among their more impressive features, collector robots possess a hardened artificial intelligence, maintaining a singular focus on their mission directives even when wandering out of communication range with their owners. They tend to react swiftly to movement and perceived threats to their physical security, either emitting loud tones or alarms as a preemptive warning, or flying upward to gain altitude before assessing a given situation and potentially opening fire in defense of itself. Some collector robots grow more lax in their analysis protocols over time, giving way to a state similar to paranoia if left in the field for too long. This corrupted logic inevitably leads them to interpret even the most innocuous actions as proof of hostile intent. Other collectors become fixated on their directive to retrieve specimens without undue damage, interpreting it as a need to protect their targets from all possible sources of harm.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Collector robots have no defined Ecology, as they are built by others and gifted with a unique purpose and skill set. Most often, they emerge from automated factories, engineering shops, and scrap heaps under the direction of a controlling authority that activates them and assigns their missions. Thereafter, the power cores of collector robots last indefinitely. Most collector robots have fusion generators, but some have the ability to derive power from the sun,  making them capable of recharging several weeks' worth of operating power with solar energy in a single daytime \"sleep\" cycle. During prolonged missions, collector robots often support one another in the absence of their masters, dragging damaged units back to repair facilities and cooperating to achieve any mutual goals. Collector robots have a similar protectiveness toward other robots of various types, treating them almost like siblings.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Collector robots have little in the way of organized society, but do array themselves in a rigid hierarchy as designated by their controlling authority. Individual collectors may carry a higher rank than other robots, and thus are capable of commanding lesser machines they encounter or even overriding their programming with new directives as they commandeer aid in carrying out their assigned missions. This often leads to symbiotic relationships with servant robots capable of repairing and assisting with their upkeep.  Collector robots first appeared in Numeria, but some have since wandered further afield, slaves to their dedicated programming as they go about cataloging, tagging, and occasionally tracking various life forms- sentient or otherwise. Some rogue collector robots kidnap people and creatures, and secret them away in remote caves. Others cascaded from the starship <i>Divinity</i> during its original descent, falling to Golarion as newly deployed probes far outside the range of Unity's control, thus free to pursue individual interests. A few enterprising Technic League wizards and alchemists have managed to control some of these automatons, taming and reprogramming them to suit their purposes. New directives for these automatons typically involve the abduction or assassination of targets that their overseers program into them.  <strong><strong></strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>Variants</strong></strong></p><p>  The chassis developed for collector robots has proven exceptionally versatile over the years, giving rise to multiple configurations and alternate capabilities. These are less likely to be encountered than a typical collector robot. Some of the models include:  <br /><strong>Aquatic Collector Robots (CR +0):</strong> Adapted for use in marine environments, aquatic collector robots abandon flight for a swim speed of 30 ft. Their integrated stun guns still function underwater, though they are based on frequencies designed to work more eff iciently in aquatic environments.  <br /><strong>Extermination Robots (CR +1):</strong> Newly encountered life forms can sometimes threaten the safety of landing parties or the ecological balance of controlled environments. Extermination robots serve a more specialized role than collectors, programming themselves to track and annihilate a single type of creature. This ability grants a favored enemy bonus (as the ranger class ability) against a single creature type chosen from the ranger favored enemies table. The robot also comes equipped with a longer-range arc rifleTG.  <br /><strong>Trapper Robots (CR +1):</strong> Some robots cover a wider range of territory by deploying traps rather than hunting creatures individually. Designed to capture specimens for retrieval and sedation, they have gravity-based <i>snare</i>s which function similar to the <i>snare</i> spell. They can deploy up to five of these devices and remain linked to them via tracker chips and an integrated chipfinder. When a <i>snare</i> is sprung, it sends an alert to the trapper robot, which then hurries to retrieve its quarry.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Iron_Gods.jpg","_id":"EL9gR0PstgXFmOu7"}

Their instruments were networked to form a web of sensors spread out over a wide area to retrieve superior surveillance for their masters. Years after these networked robots ceased receiving orders, numerous observer robots rewrote their programming and assembled into collectives that numbered up to 1,000 individual observer robots. These swarms emerge from buried wreckage in dangerous metallic clouds that scour, confound, and burn creatures they attack.  While swarms are typically chaotic, roiling clouds of creatures, observer robot swarms are highly organized, with hundreds of the tiny robots moving in synchronized patterns as they fly through the air. When observer robot swarms attack, the screens on their outer hulls flicker with disorienting colors that leave their enemies nauseated. They can also organize themselves into a matrix to display composite images across the screens on their collective shells. Treating their individual screens like pixels, observer robot swarms can form moving images of things that they have recorded such as displaying the terror-stricken face of their last victim. These robot swarms even cleverly use this technique to disguise themselves as churning clouds, flickering fires, or even other swarms such as bats or wasps.  Since observer robot swarms spend much of their processing power transmitting and sharing senses with other robots in the swarm, they rarely transmit to other devices. Their recordings are shared among the collective, making harvesting recorded data from them extremely difficult.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Iron_Gods.jpg","_id":"GLusXMCFsWOj3JD5"}

On a hit, the ray deals 15d6 points of damage. When used against an object, the atomizer disintegrates as much as a 10-foot cube of nonliving matter. A creature or object that succeeds at a DC 21 Fortitude save instead takes only 5d6 points of damage. Any creature reduced to 0 or fewer hit points by this attack is entirely disintegrated, leaving behind only a trace of fine dust. A disintegrated creature's equipment is unaffected. The save DC is Intelligence-based.  </p><p><strong>Charge Fist (Ex)</strong> A juggernaut robot can charge its oversized fists with electricity as a free action, causing its slam attacks to deal 1d6 points of electricity damage. On a critical hit, a charged strike explodes with electric energy, dealing an additional 1d10 points of electricity damage. This electricity doesn't harm the juggernaut.  </p><p><strong>Combined Arms (Ex)</strong> When taking a full-attack action, a juggernaut robot can attack with its melee and ranged integrated weapons simultaneously.  </p><p><strong>Electromagnetic Pulse (Ex)</strong> Once per day as a standard action, a juggernaut robot can unleash an electromagnetic pulse in a 20- foot radius that bypasses any active force fields (or similar effects) and deals 6d6 points of electricity damage to any robots or creatures with cybernetic implants. This effect doesn't harm the juggernaut robot itself or other living creatures. Creatures affected by this attack that succeed at a DC 21 Reflex save take only half the normal amount of damage. Any technological item within this radius is drained of 1d6 charges unless the item succeeds at a DC 21 Reflex save. The save DCs are Intelligence-based.  </p><p><strong>Force Field (Ex)</strong> A juggernaut robot is sheathed in a thin layer of shimmering energy that grants it 75 bonus hit points. All damage dealt to a juggernaut with an active force field is deducted from these hit points first. As long as the force field is active, the juggernaut is immune to critical hits. A juggernaut's force field has fast healing 10, but once these bonus hit points are reduced to 0, the force field shuts down and does not reactivate for 24 hours.  </p><p><strong>Integrated Heavy Lasers (Ex)</strong> A juggernaut robot has a heavy laser rifle built into each of its arms. Each weapon has a range of 150 feet and deals 4d10 points of fire damage. Each can fire once per round in a burst of shots that attacks all creatures in a line. This line starts from any corner of the robot's space and extends to the limit of the weapon's range or until it strikes a barrier it can't penetrate. The robot must make a separate attack roll against each creature in the line, and each creature in the line can be attacked with only one shot from each burst. Each attack roll takes a -2 penalty, and its damage can't be modified by precision damage or damage-increasing feats such as Vital Strike. Invisible creatures are immune to damage caused by a laser weapon. Fog, smoke, and other clouds provide cover in addition to concealment from laser attacks. Darkness (magical or otherwise) has no effect on lasers other than providing concealment. Roll to confirm each attack roll that threatens a critical hit separately.  </p><p><strong>Targeting Array (Ex)</strong> Juggernaut robots see invisible creatures or objects as if they were visible. In addition, because of their complex array of sensors, juggernauts suffer no miss chance if a target has concealment, and reduce the miss chance from total concealment to 20%.  </p><p><strong>Vicious Trample (Ex)</strong> A juggernaut robot's massive steel feet deal 6d6+19 points of damage on a successful trample attack.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Easily the rarest of all robots in Numeria, these metallic monstrosities wreak havoc upon those who trespass upon the remnants of the strange vessel that crashed into Golarion's crust eons ago. The original reasons behind the creation of such titanic constructs remains a mystery. However, the Technic League quickly surmised that these metal giants excelled at rendering other Numerian technology inert, which may give clues to the constructs' purpose. Wrought from a strange metallic alloy similar to iron and containing bizarre electronics and delicate sensors, the juggernaut rises to a height of 50 feet and weighs well over 100 tons.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  To all but a select few, the juggernaut's inner workings are an inscrutable tangle of wires, circuits, and strange metallic widgets. Its crude humanoid silhouette, complete with dangling simian-like forearms, belies its alien visage: a sleek dome with a single, unblinking ovoid eye, behind which lies a dazzling array of multihued sensors. Thick cords twist over the robot's forearms before feeding into   cannon-like barrels that pulse with energy. Oversized fists crackle with lightning and explode with thunderous force upon impact. However terrible these weapons are, nothing in the juggernaut's arsenal is feared more than the ray of death that its central orb emits-a sickly hued beam that reduces all materials to a fine green dust. Luckily, this devastating attack is heralded by a series of swirling lights and high-pitched whines that mimic a colossal teapot about to explode.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  These goliaths serve as sentinels to the larger shards of their shattered starship. Occasionally mistaken for enormous statuary or tributes left behind from a forgotten age, these humongous robots lie inert until the location they guard is breached. At that point, they come to life amid the loud whir of alien machinery, the stench of ozone, and the terrified screams of the intruders. Luckily, the sites these brutes guard often lie deep within Silver Mount, out of reach of all but the most determined scavengers.  Strangely, these massive constructs seem to have a close, almost paternalistic, relationship towards the more common gearsmen of Numeria. Most attempts by the Technic League to get a juggernaut to attack a functioning gearsman prove ineffective, and much like their smaller counterparts, juggernauts respond to both threats and censure with inscrutable silence.  <br /><strong>Known Juggernaut Robots</strong><br /> Though the Technic League has spent decades excavating technological wonders from the wreckage of the spacecraft that crashed to Golarion so long ago, only a few of the juggernauts that have been reclaimed still have any semblance of functionality. Descriptions of the most intensively studied specimens follow.  <br /><strong>The Living Monument:</strong> Straddling a deep crater and polished to a blinding sheen, this robot is worshiped by an indigenous tribe of Kellid warriors. Having calculated that the Kellids harbor no desire to unearth the cosmic shard that it has guarded for millennia, this juggernaut impassively tolerates the veneration it receives. The fact that its Kellid worshipers zealously oppose the Technic League's attempts to access the juggernaut causes the automaton to regard them as lesser guardians, almost as though they were gearsmen.  <br /><strong>Specimen One:</strong> Unearthed deep beneath Silver Mount, this juggernaut was found inert within a colossal chamber. The debased arcanists of the Technic League disassembled the dormant hulk and catalogued its every wire, circuit, and cog. When they finished, they began the long, arduous process of reassembly. Unfortunately, their efforts were only partially successful. Now, only the juggernaut's massive robotic head remains \"alive,\" forever calculating how it might escape from this pathetic existence amid a labyrinth of frayed wires, pitted alien alloys, and strange flickering bulbs.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Iron_Gods.jpg","_id":"JB7EZZ1bbwSoKPpu"}

Cunning and brutal, maraxes are far-ranging predators from Castrovel's mist-shrouded landscape. Gifted with vicious weapons, dense armor, and a paralytic venom, a single marax is a match for even the greatest hunter. A pack can easily bring down Castrovel's largest creatures and defend their territory against the planet's most fearsome competitors.  Variations of maraxes dot Castrovel's different regions just as big cats stalk Golarion's. Different subspecies can be identified by their varying fur colors and patterns and the arrangement of ridges on their dorsal plates. Maraxes typically stand 9 to 10 feet tall and weigh up to 900 pounds.  Ecology  While they are far from the most dangerous predators on their homeworld, maraxes stand among the planet's more successful hunters thanks to their inherent adaptability. Perfectly suited to the forests and plains of Castrovel, they roam enormous territories as lone hunters or in small packs.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Their seasonal migrations create famine in their wakes as they drain a region of fauna, and entire lashunta (<i>Pathfinder Campaign Setting</i>: <i>Inner Sea Bestiary</i> 25) villages may relocate seasonally to avoid starvation. Maraxes possess only a single lung, and those introduced to alien environments often become extremely irritable due to shortness of breath.  Maraxes are overwhelmingly carnivorous. The larger, more aggressive females dominate their packs, bringing down prey and eating first. Maraxes have voracious appetites, and will make a meal of almost anything-in lean times the animals turn to carrion, fruit, and in rare cases even soil and stones to sate their voracious appetites.  Straddling the line between mammal and reptile, maraxes are warm-blooded creatures with resilient bodies. Soft fur covers tough scales across much of a marax's body, while bony knobs protect the head, back, thighs, and tail. A marax's most identifiable feature is its tough dorsal osteoderms that offer protection. They lack forelimbs, and balance instead on a single pair of legs tipped with vicious, scythe-like claws. Their oversized jaws can crush both bone and stone, and larger specimens can even tear through metal armor. A cluster of venomous barbs sprout from the end of a marax's tail, which can inject enough paralytic venom to bring down prey twice the creature's size.  These statistics represent a typical marax. Various subspecies may be larger or smaller (use the giant creature or young creature simple templates accordingly) and possess a variety of different special abilities. The arctic-dwelling tundrax is smaller, but can hibernate for months beneath the snow and reawaken in moments to pounce upon unsuspecting prey, while females of the bioluminescent ghostback marax possess a resin-producing gland that grants them an ability similar to the web special ability.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Maraxes are found all across Castrovel, but exist primarily in its primeval forests and vast savannas. Dozens of subspecies fill the planet's various ecological niches, and maraxes range from the polar tundra to steaming tropical jungles. Thanks to Castrovel's dramatic tides and powerful weather systems, regular migration is a way of life, and packs can cover hundreds of miles between seasonal hunting grounds. Some subspecies follow staple herds, while others alternate between a variety of environments and diets throughout the year. Most maraxes spend dry seasons stalking small prey in wooded areas or deep in Castrovel's countless hidden valleys, then during wet seasons move onto open savanna to take down larger prey. Wherever they settle for a time, packs use their powerful claws to dig out shallow nests, which shelter a complex <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p> of scavengers and opportunistic mammals once the beasts move on.  Most breeds of maraxes are social animals that form complex hierarchies. They vocalize a variety of chirps,  growls, and rasping grunts, and establish relative status with bellowing exchanges that lashunta call \"debates.\" The largest female typically leads the pack, and surrounds herself with the other breeding-age females for hunting and territorial defense. Males and females not of breeding age rely on this matriarch's circle for food, and are expected to groom the hunters and one another for parasites. All members of a pack contribute to marking and defending territory and to scavenging during lean times. The social bonds are knit tight, and packs are more likely to move on to new hunting grounds than drive out members in hard times. An alpha female remains fertile so long as she is well fed, and especially successful matriarchs can grow to enormous sizes and dominate packs of fifty or more, cultivating legends and nicknames among lashunta hunters.  Non-alpha females breed only two or three litters in a lifetime. Females attract the attention of males using their tail barbs, and engage other females in mock combat to claim the healthiest mates. If a male shows interest, the female bonds her clutch of two to four eggs to his underbelly with a sticky resin. The father becomes incubator and guardian for the next 16 months. Hatchlings are born with soft, flexible back plates, and adults claw and nip at a pup's back to transform the soft cartilage into thick, sturdy osteoderms. The venom both males and females produce in their tails is a complex array of proteins and enzymes that the hatchlings suckle for nourishment during their vulnerable first few days. As one would expect, maraxes are very protective parents; packs will chase kidnappers for miles and tear them apart with an almost gleeful cruelty.   Thanks to Castrovel's numerous planetary portals, maraxes occasionally migrate to other worlds. A smaller, wheezing variety prowls Akiton's equator, riding the planet's massive dust storms from hunting ground to hunting ground. On Golarion, a few small packs roam Numeria and southern Garund, preying on the megafauna in these locations.  Among Castrovel's civilizations, capturing or slaying a marax is an impressive achievement. As maraxes' natural weapons can be used to craft vicious daggers, spears, and terbutje, those capable of reliably trapping or hunting the creatures earn impressive fortunes and high prestige.  Near rural settlements, maraxes stalk domesticated herds for easy meals, and even pick off careless hunters and shepherds without fear. Their hunting tactics are so effective that some lashunta have bred a loyal domesticated subspecies to guard their wilderness settlements from predation. Though ravenous and ill tempered, these tame maraxes are unf laggingly loyal. Druidic sects see the creature as a powerful totem, crafting fetishes from the animal's bones and plates and divining prophecies from packs' seasonal migrations.  <br /><strong>Marax Companions</strong><br />  <strong>Starting Statistics</strong>: <strong>Size</strong> Medium; <strong>Speed</strong> 30 ft.; <strong>AC</strong> +3 natural armor; <strong>Attack</strong> bite (1d6), tail barbs* (1d4 plus poison); <strong>Ability Scores</strong> Str 16, Dex 15, Con 12, Int 2, Wis 12, Cha 6; <strong>Special <strong>Attack</strong>s</strong> poison (frequency 1 round [4], effect 1d2 Dex damage, cure 1 save, Con-based DC); <strong>Special Qualities</strong> low-light vision, scent. *This is a secondary natural attack.  <strong>7th-level Adjustments</strong>: <strong>Size</strong> Large, <strong>AC</strong> +2 natural armor; <strong>Attack</strong> bite (1d8), 2 claws (1d4); <strong>Ability Scores</strong> Str +6, Dex -2, Con +2; <strong>Special Qualities</strong> pounce</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Iron_Gods.jpg","_id":"N2UzBB1qIj17y7v3"}

Each stored brain grants a yah-thelgaad a cumulative +2 insight bonus to AC, concentration checks, and Knowledge checks. A yah-thelgaad can extract a brain from a helpless opponent with a coup de grace attack, or as a standard action from a body that has been dead for no more than 1 minute. A yah-thelgaad that has fewer than six collected brains gains two negative levels for each missing brain. These negative levels never become permanent, and can only be removed by replacing one of the yah-thelgaad's collected brains. The statistics presented here assume a yah-thelgaad with a full collection.  </p><p><strong>Carapace (Ex)</strong> The spikes on a yah-thelgaad's carapace make melee attacks against it hazardous. Any opponent attempting to attack a yah-thelgaad with a light weapon, unarmed strike, touch attack, or natural attack must succeed at a DC 22 Reflex save or take 1d6 points of bleed damage from these bristling barbs. Bleed damage from multiple failed Reflex saves does not stack. The save DC is Dexterity-based.  </p><p><strong>Command Disease (Su)</strong> As a swift action, a yah-thelgaad can cause a disease or infection currently afflicting a creature within 30 feet to quicken and activate, forcing the afflicted creature to immediately attempt a saving throw against the disease's effects. Those who fail immediately suffer the disease's effects. These additional saving throws count against those one must succeed at to recover from a disease, so it's possible for a victim to be cured by succeeding at enough saving throws. Any creature that has been affected by a yah-thelgaad's command disease ability (whether or not the creature succeeded at the saving throw this ability triggered) takes a -2 penalty against any mind-affecting spell or effect generated by the yah-thelgaad in the next minute.  </p><p><strong>Mind Storm (Su)</strong> As a standard action once every 1d4 rounds, a yah-thelgaad can employ its own brain as well as any brains kept in its blisters to create a powerful psychic vortex. When the creature activates this ability, all creatures within a 40-foot radius must succeed at DC 23 Will save or become confused for 1d4 rounds. When a yah-thelgaad activates this ability, it can choose to absorb one of its brains as a swift action to cause one creature within the area of effect that has succumbed to the <i>confusion</i>  effect to instead become stunned for 1d4 rounds. A creature stunned in this manner is confused for 1d4 rounds after the stun effect ends. A yah-thelgaad generally saves this tactic for when it's faced with a particularly dangerous foe, since the stun effect forces the yah-thelgaad to lose one of its stored brains and gain 2 negative levels. This is a mind-affecting <i>confusion</i> effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Poison (Ex)</strong> Claw-injury; <i>save</i> Fort DC 26; <i>frequency</i> 1/round for 6 rounds; <i>effect</i> 1d4 Strength damage and nauseated for 1 round; <i>cure</i> 2 consecutive <i>save</i>s. The save DC is Constitution-based.  </p><p><strong>Powerful Tentacles (Ex)</strong> A yah-thelgaad's tentacles are primary attacks.  </p><p><strong>Spells (Su)</strong> A yah-thelgaad casts spells as a 12th-level sorcerer. Its caster level is reduced by 2 for each negative level it gains from missing brains. A yah-thelgaad with no collected brains can't cast any of its spells.  </p><p><strong>Spellstrike (Su)</strong> Whenever a yah-thelgaad casts a spell with a range of \"touch,\" it can deliver the spell through its claw attack as part of a melee attack. Instead of the free melee touch attack normally allowed to deliver the spell, the yah-thelgaad can make one free melee attack with its claw as part of casting the spell. If successful, this claw attack deals its normal damage (including poison) as well as the effects of the spell.  </p><p><strong>Strange Knowledge (Ex)</strong> All knowledge skills are class skills for yah-thelgaads.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>When a neh-thalggu has absorbed a critical mass of thoughts and memories from an unknown number of humanoid brains, its body undergoes a horrific transformation. The creature enters a state of torpor, its body curling into a tight ball as it consumes the oldest of its seven stored brains to trigger the metamorphosis. Over the course of several days of self-consumption, the neh-thalggu bursts from the shell of its old body into its new incarnation as a yah-thelgaad.  While the yah-thelgaad shares many of the features of its less powerful progenitor, it is in every way a more powerful creature than it was before. While the capacity to store one fewer brain than a neh-thalggu presents some disadvantage, the yah-thelgaad gains twice as much power from a collected brain as its lesser kin does. In addition, these creatures need not limit their harvest to the brains of humanoids-any Small or Medium creature's brain will do.    Yah-thelgaads are zealously devoted to the inscrutable causes of the Dominion of the Black, but they are also notoriously devout believers in that alliance's weird theology, worshiping a concept they refer to as the \"Ineffable Void,\" among other cryptic mysteries. It is not uncommon for yah-thelgaads of high rank to also possess inquisitor or oracle levels, lording their authority and fanatical faith over those in their charge-the most powerful yah-thelgaads often take levels in mystic theurge to combine their class-based mastery of the divine with their stolen brains' arcane lore.  Yah-thelgaads often supervise the Dominion of the Black's surgical and genetic engineers on major projects, pushing those agents to attempt greater and more horrific procedures. For all their legendary cruelty, however, yah-thelgaads don't appear to gain pleasure from such experiments. Indeed, they don't seem to feel any emotions at all on their own, but rather experience such sensations vicariously through the memories of the brains they've collected. In this way, the creatures know lust, fear, hatred, and pride without exposing their own minds to the disadvantages of being susceptible to mind-affecting effects.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Iron_Gods.jpg","_id":"Okew5JZErfqbhPmS"}

It does not provoke attacks of opportunity with its flechette spray attacks when using combined arms.  </p><p><strong>Expert Climber (Ex)</strong> An ugothokra's feet allow it to climb any surface, no matter how slick or sheer. In effect, an ugothokra is treated as constantly being under the effects of <i>spider climb</i>, though this is effect is natural rather than magical.  </p><p><strong>Flechette Spray (Ex)</strong> An ugothokra can fire bursts of calcified bone and horn from the vents along its abdomen. All six vents can fire as part of a full-attack action, or it can fire one vent as a standard action. This attack has a range increment of 50 feet. An ugothokra generates the \"ammunition\" it uses for this attack internally by feeding on organic material, and effectively has an unlimited supply of flechette material at any one time, but an ugothokra that is currently starving can't use this attack until at least 1 hour after feeding.  </p><p><strong>Infected Blood (Ex)</strong> A creature that damages an ugothokra with a slashing or piercing melee weapon (regardless of how often the ugothokra is damaged) must succeed at a DC 20 Reflex saving throw at the end of its turn or be sprayed by the ugothokra's infected blood. A creature that damages an ugothokra with a slashing or piercing natural weapon automatically fails this saving throw. On a failed saving throw, the creature is exposed to a random viral infection (see below), but gains a +4 bonus on the Fortitude save to resist contracting whatever disease it is exposed to. Unlike when a victim contracts an infection from an ugothokra's flechette spray, diseases caught via contact with the monster's blood have normal <i>onset</i> times as determined by the disease in question. The Reflex save is Dexterity-based.  </p><p><strong>Poison (Ex)</strong> Bite-injury; <i>save</i> Fort DC 19; <i>frequency</i> 1/round for 6 rounds; <i>effect</i> 1d4 Con plus sickened for 1 round; <i>cure</i> 2 consecutive <i>save</i>s.  </p><p><strong>Viral Infection (Su)</strong> An ugothokra's body is infested with numerous potent and highly infectious diseases engineered by their Dominion creators to cause highly specific conditions in those they infect. An ugothokra's blood carries these diseases, and while the creature can transmit random infections by means of contact with its blood, the most efficient method of transmission is via its flechette spray. Most ugothokras carry the following three contagions in their systems, and they can decide which one to inflict on a target as part of the act of firing a flechette spray-it can even inflict different diseases with different sprays in the same round if it so chooses. Some ugothokras carry additional viral infections that are tailored by their Dominion creators for incredibly specialized tasks. A creature exposed to any of these viral infections can resist the infection with a successful DC 19 Fortitude save, but on a failed save, the effect occurs immediately and the <i>onset</i> time is ignored. Contracting an infection via the ugothokra's blood is not as efficient and uses the listed <i>onset</i> time. The most common viral infections available to an ugothokra are listed below.  <i>Aklo Submission</i>: Disease-injury or contact; save Fort DC 19; <i>onset</i> 1 day; frequency 1/day; effect 1d2 Wisdom drain (can't drain Wisdom below 0) plus susceptibility to Aklo; cure 2 consecutive saves. As long as a creature is infected with this disease (even if the creature isn't currently suffering any Wisdom drain from the disease), it becomes unusually compliant and responsive to commands issued to it in Aklo. Any Bluff, Diplomacy, or Intimidate check attempted against the character while speaking in Aklo gains a +4 bonus. Furthermore, as a full-round action, any creature can issue a command to the victim in Aklo to attempt to affect the victim with a <i>suggestion</i> effect (effective CL 5th, regardless of the commander's level)-the victim can resist this <i>suggestion</i> with a successful DC 14 Will save. Once a victim of Aklo submission succeeds at a Will save to resist such a <i>suggestion</i>, it can't be further affected in this way by any Aklo-speaking creature for 24 hours.  <i>Flesh Ripen Fever</i>: Disease-injury or contact; save Fort DC 19; <i>onset</i> 1d4 days; frequency 1/day; effect 1d3 Con damage plus stench; cure 2 consecutive saves. A character suffering from flesh ripen fever exudes a nauseating stench as his skin decays and sloughs off, leaving behind reeking pits of stinking flesh. The victim is automatically sickened by its own smell, as are all creatures within a 10-foot radius. A successful DC 14 Fortitude save allows a creature to ignore the sickening effect for 24 hours-the victim of flesh ripen fever doesn't get such a saving throw to avoid being sickened. This stench is a poison effect that doesn't affect creatures associated with the Dominion of the Black.  <i>Implant Rejection Syndrome</i>: Disease-injury or contact; save Fort DC 19; <i>onset</i> 1d4 days; frequency 1/day; effect 1d2 Con drain plus 1d2 Int drain plus implant rejection; cure 2 consecutive saves. This insidious sickness is particularly devastating to creatures with cybernetic implants. Such creatures take a -2 penalty on all saving throws attempted to resist this disease. Further, each time a saving throw to resist its effect is attempted and failed, the creature takes 2d6 points of damage and loses the use of one randomly selected cybernetic implant for 24 hours.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>One of many artificially engineered species grown and molded in Dominion of the Black labs, ugothokras were designed specifically to spread contagions through organic enemy ranks. Immune to disease, ugothokras have small bodies that are capable of hosting a limitless number of contagions within their blood.  Ugothokras are incapable of reproduction, and when additional ones are required by the Dominion of the Black, replacements are constructed from organic and cybernetic components. The construction facilities typically operate within the organic walls of Dominion installations, the little beasts crawling out from birthing tubes protruding from their semi-organic incubators. These incubators are of widely varying size and capacity. Smaller versions, possessing no more than two birthing tubes, can produce an ugothokra every hour if provided the proper nutrients (typically curdled flesh harvested from victims of flesh ripen fever), fed to it through the living walls in which the incubator is nestled. Significantly larger incubators with dozens of birthing tubes have been reported, their size limited only by the resources needed to create more offspring.  A newborn ugothokra is completely autonomous and fully functional. While ugothokras can't fly, their immunity to cold and the fact that they don't breathe make them ideal bioweapons for use against enemy vessels in space-often, a Dominion ship's exterior swarms with ugothokras, and as they near an enemy ship, dozens of the tenacious aberrations drop off to cling to the enemy's hull. The creatures skitter along surfaces, searching for points of entry so they can infect the vessel's crew and spread their sickness. Often, these entry points are created for them via battle damage from other Dominion weaponry. Many Dominion ships have had great success at using ugothokras to spread Aklo submission among enemy crews, allowing the Dominion to order their victims to power down and submit. Those that manage to resist still typically fall under the grinding legs and mouth parts of swarms of ugothokras.  Rumors of variant ugothokras abound, including swarms or larger varieties, and those possessing even more potent and deadly diseases. Given the prodigious industry of the Dominion of the Black, such rumors hardly seem far fetched.  An ugothokra stands only about 2 1/2 feet tall, with a leg span approaching 6 feet. Most weigh around 150 pounds.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Iron_Gods.jpg","_id":"QmIt8NqZ8jHsO1Ya"}

He does not provoke attacks of opportunity with his integrated gravity rifle when using combined arms.  </p><p><strong>Force Field (Ex)</strong> Alling Third incorporated a force field generator into his mechanical body. Alling is sheathed in a thin layer of shimmering energy that grants him 200 bonus hit points. All damage dealt to the lich while his force field is active is deducted from these hit points first. As long as the force field is active, Alling is immune to critical hits. Alling's force field has fast healing 20, but once these bonus hit points are reduced to 0, the force field shuts down and doesn't reactivate for 24 hours.  </p><p><strong>Integrated Gravity Rifle (Ex)</strong> Alling Third has a built-in gravity rifle. This weapon uses a focused beam of gravitons to create a bolt of force. The integrated gravity rifle has two settings-switching between settings is a swift action. On its pulse setting, it can be used as a typical beam weapon that deals 4d6 points of force damage; on its sustained setting, the weapon creates a stable beam of gravitons rather than a short, destructive burst. In sustained mode, the integrated gravity rifle can be used to move and manipulate objects at a distance, similar to a <i>telekinesis</i> spell in its sustained force or combat maneuver versions. The graviton beam can move objects weighing no more than 350 pounds up to 20 feet per round. A creature can negate this effect on an object in its possession with a successful DC 27 Reflex save. If used to perform a combat maneuver, the beam uses Alling's CMB with a +4 bonus, and uses his Intelligence modifier in place of his Strength or Dexterity modifier. The save DC is Intelligence-based.  </p><p><strong>Part Machine (Ex)</strong> Alling Third is more than just a human with cybernetics installed in his body. Most of his current form is machine and his body is undead. In this current form, Alling's Strength is increased by +6, and he can use the touch attack granted to the lich (along with the paralyzing touch special attack) by touching an enemy with his mechanical arms. Alling's current form is also well armored; his mechanical body provides hardness 15 until he is reduced to 50 or fewer hit points. At that point, Alling's channel resistance drops from +8 to +4, but his lich defensive abilities also kick in, and he receives the benefit of his damage reduction. In addition, the cyborg-lich has found ways to incorporate his magic items into his mechanical body.</p></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Iron_Gods.jpg","_id":"R6kYvyZmvFBUTXNo"}

If a weapon in this aura has a misfire value, its misfire value increases by 2.  </p><p><strong>Wings (Ex)</strong> A yarahkut's wings are primary attacks.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Yarahkuts are inevitables (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2</i> 161) tasked with preventing magic and technology throughout the cosmos from falling into the wrong hands. Their mandate is to track objects that could disrupt the development of cultures that are not yet ready to wield such power. In most cases, yarahkuts monitor the movement of advanced technologies and magical items from lost civilizations,  ensuring they aren't introduced to regions where they could have a disruptive impact.  Noted for their intricate brass wings, yarahkuts have superb control of these appendages and are able to use them as effective weapons. Three identical faces surround a yarahkut's head, staring impassively in separate directions with glowing golden eyes. Of its two sets of arms, one set bears claws for combat, while the remaining set is more humanoid and is used to manipulate objects-including those items it confiscates. A yarahkut stands 11 feet tall and weighs 3,000 pounds.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  These inevitables scour the planes for those in possession of items beyond their ability to control-or more accurately, beyond what the yarahkuts believe they can control-and ensure that such items do not remain in unsafe hands for long. Each yarahkut has jurisdiction over a specific territory and monitors its region for such trespasses, tracking any new piece of technology or major magical item that enters its assigned area. If an item is determined to be a threat, the yarahkut pursues its retrieval or destruction without reservation.  A yarahkut's distinctive wings are for more than just flight; the inevitable has remarkable control over these mechanical appendages. The wings are just as sharp and dangerous as its razorlike claws, and double as weapons in combat. The grace with which yarahkuts use their wings awes members of many primitive cultures, who often mistake these inevitables for celestials. Only those familiar with the nature of yarahkuts understand that their wings are weapons first, and a mode of transportation second.  Compared to most other types of inevitable, yarahkuts take extra care to avoid being destroyed on their missions. While all inevitables know that if they're destroyed, replacements will simply emerge from the forges of Axis to continue their work, yarahkuts understand that their destruction would extend the time that signif icantly advanced items are allowed to contaminate their assigned territories. Bereft of any form of innate teleportation or planar travel, yarahkuts are willing to retreat from combat if it means surviving in order to gather reinforcements or formulate a new plan.  Yarahkuts are supported in their task by a wide array of abilities; those who study these inevitables learn to fear their dismantling gazes in particular. Just by scrutinizing an item, a yarahkut is capable of disassembling it in a manner of moments, to the dismay of those who wield dangerous items against the inevitable. Yarahkuts also exude an aura that tampers with nearby mechanical items. This aura causes mechanical weapons such as crossbows and firearms to become misaligned and misfire, and can affect even advanced technology such as laser weapons.   Once a yarahkut has tracked its quarry, it uses its innate <i>arcane sight</i> to identify any threats that require disposal and unceremoniously relieves the target of these items. Once the transgressor has had its dangerous possessions removed, the yarahkut uses its mind-affecting abilities to strip relevant memories from the target. If the target has expert knowledge of technology or has been exposed to dangerous items for long periods of time-such as a gun maker in a primitive land or an engineer who built a weapon that could instantly destroy millions-the inevitable resorts to a thorough memory wipe or simple execution.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Yarahkuts are mostly solitary outsiders, each with its own \"jurisdiction\" consisting of a meticulously assembled base of power and network of contacts from across the planes. Whenever possible, yarahkuts attempt to stay removed from the mundane affairs of the material world, running their networks through intermediaries and sending agents to investigate dangerous items before committing to a mission themselves. Those in service to a yarahkut rarely realize the true nature of their benefactor, whose identity is disguised by the inevitable's heightened ability to understand and adapt to other cultures. After reviewing the intelligence gathered by their agents, yarahkuts begin planning their retrieval missions. They are meticulous creatures, and attempt to plan for as many contingencies as possible to ensure success.  As they lack innate means of traveling the planes, yarahkuts may seek aid in arriving at the location of this wayward technology-including help from mortal spellcasters who summon them. Some conjurers seeking to bind a yarahkut tempt it with information about dangerous or prohibited technology being used in the inevitable's jurisdiction. Most conjurers fail to realize, though, that the yarahkut often already knows of the dangerous technology, word of which likely trickled through its established network of informants long ago; the yarahkut had counted on being summoned so it could pursue the item itself.  In rare circumstances, yarahkuts form alliances with others of their kind. These alliances most often occur in response to the distribution of a large cache of volatile items across overlapping yarahkut jurisdictions, or the unearthing of dangerous artifacts with immediate repercussions for a large region.  Sometimes yarahkuts seek out other types of inevitables when the need arises. For example, a situation in which a powerful undead creature has discovered a lost army of robots may prompt an alliance of convenience with a marut. If a bargain was broken regarding powerful technology, a yarahkut might instead align with a kolyarut, while a death-marked exile from Numeria bringing stolen items to other nations might necessitate working with a zelekhut in order to track the renegade down.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Iron_Gods.jpg","_id":"SJBBpTzbMsTHa6ll"}

Created as a result of experiments by members of the Technic League, a handful of irradiated dead escaped their restraints and set off across Numeria, creating more of their kind with each kill. With the strange chemicals and radiation coursing through their bodies and augmenting survival and hunting instincts, they scour the Numerian wastes in search of prey. Irradiated dead generally appear the same size as the humanoids they once were, but they weigh less due to their bodies have been ravaged by radiation.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  The secretive cabal known as the Technic League has always looked for ways to bolster its military power beyond the use of the gearsmen. Over the past couple centuries, the League's members have made numerous foul discoveries by studying the strange relics, technologies, and chemicals collected from the ruins of <i>Divinity</i>.  Originally conceived by a Technic League lieutenant as more reliable and easily replaceable minions than the gearsmen, the irradiated dead were the result of a series of experiments conducted in the shadow of the Silver Mount. The lieutenant was skilled in the use of necromancy magic, a study not normally mastered by Technic League members. She gathered a group of the strongest young warriors in Starfall-all of whom sought to make names for themselves in the service of the Black Sovereign-and subjected them to round after round of brutal endurance tests, injections of chemicals and drugs, savage bloodletting, and forced starvation until their bodies couldn't take any more.  The lieutenant administered to the warriors a number of chemical compounds recovered from a medical bay within Silver Mount that were originally intended to aid the crew of the <i>Divinity</i> in surviving in strange and hostile environments. Lacking full understanding of what they were working with, the lieutenant and her apprentices mixed and distilled these strange chemicals into a viscous, orange fluid that augmented physical strength and coordination while also thickening the outer layers of skin to a rocklike hardness. She believed that replacing the subjects' blood with the orange liquid, along with   controlled exposure to a smashed piece of wreckage leaking radiation, would yield the obedient soldiers she desired. When the first two test subjects completed the regimen, they awoke with a savage hunger for the flesh of their kind and rose up to fight her. The lieutenant escaped that first trial with only the loss of her right eye and her right hand just above the wrist. Her two apprentices were not so lucky. Subsequent refinements and tests yielded no better results. Though these latest test subjects retained their free will, their hunger for raw flesh was just as potent as the earlier attempts. And as they're generally more powerful than their Technic League creators, the irradiated dead saw no reason to serve their creators in any way.  Not long after these experiments, several irradiated dead were turned loose or escaped. Rumors persist within the Technic League of study specimens that were kept in secret, and some foolish young sub-commanders are looking to restart the project.  Burning inside with necrotic radiation, the irradiated dead display enhanced strength and coordination. Their skin and pupils are tinted pale orange like the fluids that replaced their blood. Their fingers transform into savage claws as sharp as ragged metal. Unexpectedly, the creatures show a remarkable resistance to the effects of positive energy that are deadly to most other forms of undead. They are also carriers of the radiation treatment that fueled their transition to undeath, able to pass the aff liction to other living creatures.  Irradiated dead are carnivorous, greatly preferring fresh meat, but they aren't above eating carrion. Cunning, patient and careful hunters, irradiated dead can prey on a nomad tribe over months, ambushing small bands of warriors and feeding upon them one by one.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Most irradiated dead are natives of the broken Numerian wastes, and they continue haunting these regions in their new forms just as they inhabited the wastes in life. They generally search for new hunting grounds in solitude, but those that manage to create their own spawn travel in packs with those they have transformed. Whether roaming across the plains, hills, and valleys, or even wading through muck and waterways, they spend much of their time lurking in shadowy places on the outskirts of villages or tribal encampments. They do not generally keep personal possessions or treasure from their meals, but may use such things to lure and entrap subsequent search parties.  Though they're intelligent, the irradiated dead rarely show any inclination toward forming social groups or hierarchies, preferring to kill and eat creatures that enter their territories, though they will deal with other intelligent creatures if they must. If they encounter more powerful beings in their hunting grounds, irradiated   dead will work to trick or trap them. The irradiated dead simply move on to new territories if they are unable to eliminate the threat. An unconfirmed report by a Technic League spy in Sunder Horn, however, claimed that at least three fast-moving, orange-skinned creatures had been hunting on the outskirts of town for nearly a year. The creatures have seemingly disappeared without any further sightings in the last 18 months.  Even the Technic League is aware of the dangers these creatures could pose to the populace. The methods used to create the irradiated dead are well-guarded secrets of the Technic League. These techniques are also impossible to implement outside of Numeria, because the necrotic radiation and alien chemicals instrumental to their creation can be found nowhere else on Golarion.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Iron_Gods.jpg","_id":"TopkoLFHlhlKWEfM"}

A thought harvester's force field has fast healing 10, but once its hit points are reduced to 0, the force field shuts down and does not reactivate for 24 hours.  </p><p><strong>Integrated Nanite Injectors (Ex)</strong> A thought harvester is outfitted with two nanite injectors. These modified syringes are mounted on the end of animated, flexible tubes that feed into the robot's crystal spheres and allow it to use its harvest thoughts ability. These injectors are treated as a piercing weapons that deal 1d4 points of damage, but can't be salvaged to be used on their own.  </p><p><strong>Integrated Sonic Rifle (Ex)</strong> A thought harvester has an built-in sonic rifle slung beneath its head. This weapon has a range of 150 feet and deals 3d6 points of sonic damage.  The weapon can fire once per round and does so in a burst of shots that attacks all creatures in a line. This line starts from any corner of the robot's space and extends to the limit of the weapon's range or until it strikes a barrier it can't penetrate. The robot must make a separate attack roll against each creature in the line, and each creature in the line can be attacked with only one shot from each burst. Each attack roll takes a -2 penalty, and its damage can't be modified by precision damage or damage-increasing feats such as Vital Strike. Effects that grant concealment (such as fog or smoke) or the spells <i>blur</i>, <i>invisibility</i>, or <i>mirror image</i> don't affect this weapon's attack. Roll to confirm each attack roll that threatens a critical hit separately.  </p><p><strong>Harvest Thoughts (Ex)</strong> A thought harvester that hits a living creature with one of its integrated nanite injectors can selectively duplicate certain memories the target possesses. Each time the harvester uses this ability, it can copy one significant event (such as the events of a combat or a birthday party), or it can sift through the victim's memories as part of an interrogation that allows it to effectively ask and receive truthful answers to six questions. A successful DC 17 Will save negates the effects of this ability; mindless creatures or creatures with an Intelligence score of 1 are immune to it. Each time a creature's memories are copied through the use of this ability, it must succeed at a DC 17 Fortitude save or take 1d4 points of Intelligence drain. A creature's Intelligence score can't be drained below 1 in this way.  If successful, the target's copied memories appear as swirling mist within one of the crystal spheres socketed into the thought harvester's back. If the thought harvester is willing, helpless, or destroyed, a sphere can be removed from its socket with a successful DC 30 Disable Device check and be read by certain devices without damaging the memories within. This ability can be used on creatures that have been dead for less than 24 hours, but their brain must be mostly intact and only 1d4 memories can be harvested postmortem. The duration can be extended if the creature's brain has been preserved (such as by <i>gentle</i> repose) or if the creature possesses a brain that doesn't rot. The save DCs are Intelligence-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Thought harvesters are specialized robots designed to forcibly extract memories from a living creature or corpse. Built to survive battlefields and other hazardous environments, thought harvesters are outfitted with thick armor plating and a durable force field. Giving the thought harvester robot its name, two prehensile tendrils extend from the creature's sides, each tipped with a wickedly barbed syringe through which the creature injects sophisticated nanites into its target. These nanites immediately duplicate portions of the target's brain and return through the syringe into the thought harvester's   central core. There, the target's memories are swiftly categorized and stored in one of an array of crystalline spheres located along the robot's spine. When performed on a living target, the process is painful and can cause severe damage to the subject's cognitive reasoning capabilities. A thought harvester's head has a single glowing eye in the center, and two weapons hang beneath it. These weapons allow the thought harvester to fire bursts of sonic energy at any targets that react in an aggressive manner. A thought harvester rarely speaks, but when it does it speaks in short, monosyllabic words, and is always direct and to the point. Thought harvesters are 6 feet long and 4 feet tall. They are densely built, and weigh 1,600 lbs. A thought harvester draws energy from an eff icient internal power source and continually recycles and repairs its internal store of specialized nanites.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  A thought harvester is a militarized application of specialized thought-recovery technology. Nanites able to affect a target's thoughts or memories are used in weapons such as the id rif le or mindrender, but the nanites used in those devices become inert after performing their function. When they're instead directly injected and immediately recovered, the nanites duplicate a creature's thoughts and store them for review. The thought harvester's nimble frame and armored shell ensure effective frontline deployment of this technology.  Dozens of egg-sized crystalline spheres line the creature's spine, each solidly nestled within a socket in the creature's armored back. These spheres are normally clear, but when the robot recovers a creature's thoughts, a sphere fills with a cloudy, gray haze. A thought harvester might fill all of its crystal spheres after a dozen missions. Regular maintenance includes transferring harvested thoughts into specialized computers, but the technology to do so is lost on Golarion. Instead, the stolen thoughts within the spheres simply dissipate when a sphere is destroyed or incorrectly removed.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Thought harvesters are deployed in a variety of military situations in which specific intelligence must be recovered or eliminated, but bodily recovery of the target is unnecessary or unwise. A thought harvester can grab and carry a human  in its claw, but these robots are rarely used to capture living humanoids. A thought harvester might be assigned to invade an enemy stronghold to remove key orders from an opposing commander, or invade a prison to copy sensitive information from the mind of a spy captured by the enemy. Thought harvester robots are often used to recover critical intelligence from soldiers killed in the middle of a raging battle or that fell in irradiated environments. Thought harvesters are deployed only when overt force is acceptable, as they're neither stealthy nor subtle.  These robots show little individual personality as they go about their work of harvesting memories. Unlike other robots, which are generally content to stand perfectly motionless when not in use, thought harvesters tend to fidget, scanning for danger and waving their syringe-tipped tendrils in the air. A thought harvester cannot itself access any of the thoughts stored within the crystalline spheres, though it does retain some general idea of the memories it has previously collected.

This is a sonic effect, and the save DC is Constitution-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>A feranth uses its devastating sonic attack to incapacitate foes and follows up with its powerful bite, vicious claws, and sharp horns to tear its prey asunder. This massive ambush predator is covered with hardened ridges and mottled black skin. Its limbs end in powerful claws that it uses to dig through tough terrain. When burrowing, a feranth uses its rear legs to smash the sides of its burrow, collapsing the passage behind it. A feranth's head is adorned with two massive, forward-facing horns and four bulbous, constantly humming sacs that amplify its mighty roars. A feranth stands 25 feet tall and 40 feet long, and weighs between 9 and 11 tons.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  The feranths that now roam Numeria are the descendants of a group that were abducted from a far-off planet and brought to Golarion as part of an ill-fated voyage. They remained locked in their containment pods for many years after their arrival on Golarion, but the damage sustained by the pods eventually became too much-they finally failed, releasing the feranths into the unsuspecting world. Using their sharp claws, the creatures burrowed through the structurally weakened hull of the starship in which they were contained, emerging onto the surface of a strange new planet.  On their native planet, feranths were apex predators that devoured prey with endless appetite, and the few living on Golarion remain true to this behavior. Feranths move on to a new location only after exhausting most sources of available food. While feranths do eventually return to previous hunting grounds, they instinctively wait many years for food sources to replenish before terrorizing those regions once again.  Because of feranths' highly territorial nature, battles between two rivals are vicious affairs that can take hours or even days to resolve, and almost invariably end with one of the combatants bloodied, limping, and nearly dead. Yet deaths are surprisingly rare during these trials, despite the ferocity with which they are fought. It seems that feranths prefer to simply frighten and weaken their rivals rather than killing them outright.  When hunting prey, feranths tend to use ambush tactics. They often charge up through the ground once they have pinpointed their prey's location using tremorsense, and then unleash a mighty roar to further discombobulate their victims. Feranths often repeat this tactic many times during an encounter with prey, diving beneath the ground only to erupt back up a few seconds or even minutes later.    Fortunately for the inhabitants of Numeria, female feranths are rare on Golarion-a fact that keeps the beasts' numbers low. It's uncertain whether this same discrepancy in the ratio between the sexes exists on the feranths' home planet. Females are by far the most ferocious members of the species, especially in the few months following the hatching of their eggs. During this time, a female feranth can be identified by her mottled red-brown skin tone and vicious temperament. For 3 months after their eggs hatch, female feranths have the blood rage universal monster ability. A female usually mates multiple times during her lifetime, laying two eggs each time. She cares for her offspring for 3 years before the juveniles abandon their mother, leaving in search of their own territories in which to hunt. Juvenile feranths that have just left their families are often about 12 feet tall and 20 feet long.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Scholars believe that feranths' behavior on Golarion is much the same now as it was on their home planet, with one key difference: their range. Rather than roaming great swaths of territory like their ancestors did, feranths on Golarion remain primarily in Numeria. Some of these creatures have wandered into the Worldwound, however, and every now and then one rampages through the northern reaches of the River Kingdoms, across the southern border of Mendev, or along the eastern edge of Brevoy. For unknown reasons, feranths avoid treading into Ustalav.  Feranths prefer to carve their lairs out of hillsides where they can monitor the passage of potential prey, but  they sometimes dig dens deep underground to protect themselves from ambush by rival feranths. It is most common for a feranth to construct its home underground when other feranths threaten its territory, but females of the species also dig underground lairs when they are ready to lay and hatch their eggs. Thus, the presence of an underground feranth lair is a sign of greater danger: either the nearby area is infested with other feranths, or the den belongs to a ferocious feranth mother.  Crafty Kellid tribes have learned some tricks, such as the use of earplugs or silencing magic, to counteract the beasts' advantages. They also bait feranths into traps or enclosed canyons using livestock or other large animals. The Kellids use these tactics not only to fight these alien beasts, but also to capture them-a few captive feranths have even been trained for warfare by various tribes. Powerful alchemical concoctions are mixed and fed to a captive feranth, as it is necessary to cloud the creature's mind to tame it. In this state, the feranth becomes docile and seemingly forgets how to burrow, making it easy for the tribe to keep its prized beast nearby. Once the feranth's mind is clouded, blinders can be attached to limit the creature's field of vision, allowing a brave barbarian rider to guide it in battle. When the time comes for the feranth to fight, a second concoction is fed to the beast to give it a burst of energy, sending it into a rampage.  The Red Dog tribe in Numeria's Sellen Hills was renowned for many years for its control of a feranth, a feat that its leaders parleyed into an alliance between a number of nearby tribes. This alliance-and the entire Red Dog tribe-ended abruptly when the captive feranth eventually developed a tolerance to the alchemical concoctions used to keep it docile.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Iron_Gods.jpg","_id":"X5EHlP6C0EGI5LjZ"}

By withdrawing its tentacles and sensory stalks into its shell, the ghelarn gains total cover until the beginning of its next turn. The shell doesn't provide cover against targeted spells, and the ghelarn's movement is limited to downward burrowing during this time. The benefits of the shell can be lost if sundered (hardness 5, 8 hit points, regenerates in 2d6 days), and a ghelarn caught without its carapace loses its natural armor bonus.  </p><p><strong>Entrap (Ex)</strong> A ghelarn secretes a quagmire of sticky fluid a few feet below the sand where it lives. This fluid extends in a 10-foot radius around the creature and acts to trap victims, making it easier for the ghelarn to attack prey with its tentacles or feed upon it with its leeching tendrils. This otherwise acts as the entrap universal monster rule.  </p><p><strong>Hibernate (Ex)</strong> When food is scarce, a ghelarn can enter a state of hibernation for an indefinite period of time. When it enters hibernation, the ghelarn nestles itself in the sand and fills in its porous carapace with sticky excretions that quickly harden to seal the creature from the elements. When hibernating, the ghelarn doesn't have to eat or drink. A ghelarn remains in a state of hibernation until it senses another living creature within 10 feet, at which point it dissolves the seals on its carapace over the course of 1d4 minutes.  </p><p><strong>Leeching Tendrils (Ex)</strong> A living creature that spends more than a single round ensnared within a ghelarn's entrapping fluid becomes targeted by invasive tendrils from the ghelarn's lower body. These feeding stalks deal 1 point of bleed damage each round, and continue to do so for as long as a victim remains within the area of the ghelarn's entrapping fluid.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Born on the desert plain of an alien world, the soft-bodied ghelarn is a non-aquatic arthropod living within a shell-like exoskeleton manufactured from its own hardened secretions. This outer carapace contains many perforations, similar to dry coral or air-blasted stone, providing ample room from which the ghelarn can extend its outer extremities and explore the world. Chief among these appendages are two main tentacles that it uses to pull itself through the upper layers of sand within its native home, burrowing just below the surface while its hardened carapace remains above ground. As a result, ghelarns give the impression of ambulatory stone formations when traveling, but they can also abandon their shells entirely and delve deeper into the sand to avoid predators.  Patient, quiet creatures, ghelarns prefer to ambush prey, waiting until suitable meals wander within reach of their tentacles or into the sticky quagmires they create just below the surface around their nesting grounds. Helpless victims soon find themselves pulled into the sand as the ghelarn extends invasive tendrils from its lower body. These lesser tentacles slowly bleed away moisture from anyone trapped in the ooze, leaving behind little more than dried husks and bones for scavengers to find, along with whatever equipment such victims may have carried.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  During the creatures' spawning season, an entire clutch of ghelarns produces a variant musk in their secretions to attract one another. Some travel for miles in search of this scent, and the resulting orgy once a group gathers allows for a communal intermingling of reproductive oils. This impregnates multiple ghelarn at the same time, enabling them to spawn new offspring as they separate again. A typical ghelarn can create 1d3 young, which gestate for consecutive 3-month periods rather than being born all at once. Pregnant ghelarns abandon these young to fend for themselves almost as soon as they're born, moving to another region to birth more offspring rather than leaving them within the same area to compete for resources.  It takes a newborn ghelarn about 2 weeks before it can muster enough secretions to form a hardened shell of its own. During this time, it stays deep below the earth, seeking nourishment and moisture trapped in the desert soil rather than risking its vulnerable body to predators above ground. Once fully matured, it pushes upward, its shell rising from the sand to mark its domain. Sentient creatures wisely avoid these areas, though it's often hard  to tell empty shells from a living ghelarn's hunting grounds. Many societies find the abandoned and cast-off shells useful for making tools and crafting weapons and armor. As a result, ghelarn habitats frequently draw those seeking to harvest them as a resource. Unfortunately for the scavengers, these shells also attract young ghelarns who haven't yet formed their own and seek to use the abandoned ones as temporary homes.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Ghelarns typically live solitary lives. The extreme nature of their native habitat causes them to separate and spread out to avoid overhunting an area. They sometimes cooperate in pairs or packs known as clutches to defend themselves, but more frequently do so in preparation for mating season, so they can drag down large prey that they leave behind for their new offspring to feed upon. Sometimes a clutch will gather in geologically unstable regions, where quakes and tremors draw their interest. Mostly, they migrate in seemingly aimless patterns, driven away from the harsh sounds of overhead thunderstorms, as the noise causes them acute pain.  The rudimentary sentience of ghelarns places them just above animal-level intelligence. Though they have no real language of their own, they communicate warnings or call for help by turning their porous shells into the wind and adjusting the flow with their tentacles, allowing air to pass through the openings, and creating a musical \"voice\" similar to wind instruments. Each ghelarn's voice is distinctly different from any other ghelarn. Some societies have also learned to domesticate young ghelarns-these cultures train them to understand simple commands and use them as guard animals.  <br /><strong>Noble Ghelarns</strong><br />  Occasionally, evolution gives rise to a more advanced breed of ghelarn. These specimens have both the advanced and giant simple templates, and prove more intelligent than their lesser kin. The shell of a noble ghelarn encompasses a much greater area, appearing more like an outcropping of rock or a small hillside. This grants them the freeze special quality to appear as such, allowing them to take 20 on their Stealth checks to hide in plain sight. Noble ghelarns sometimes remain hidden within these massive shells and purposefully suppress their entrapping ooze in order to dupe other creatures into seeking shelter next to them. While the tall shell certainly provides shade from the sun and a windbreak against desert storms, those camping near a noble ghelarn inevitably find themselves assaulted during the night by the creature's invasive tendrils. These appendages are more leechlike than the painful barbs of lesser ghelarns and require a DC 20 Perception check for sleeping creatures to notice.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Iron_Gods.jpg","_id":"XKzUzptNwbPkZe70"}

Gravedragger must be  adjacent to the grave he intends to drag his target into. Treat this as a special drag combat maneuver.

Any creature in this area must roll two d20s whenever a situation calls for a d20 roll (such as an attack roll, a skill check, or a saving throw) and must use the lower of the two results. This is a mind-affecting effect that doesn't work on worshipers of Zyphus. Any creature that gains any sort of luck bonus (such as that granted by a <i>luckstone</i> or <i>divine</i> favor) is immune to Gravedragger's unluck aura.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Gravedragger is a cruel prankster who enjoys murdering innocents in unexpected, horrid, ironic, and tragic ways. In the same way that children fear the mysterious bogeymen, adults cower at the thought of Gravedragger bringing them to a painful end. Unlike Pharasma, who enforces fated and inevitable death, the herald of Zyphus is a break from destiny's plan-a sudden deviation that leads to danger and ruin. Gravedragger appears as a vaguely humanoid mass of grave dirt and bones, and wields a heavy pick made of a rib bone punched through a giant's skull. He also takes the form of an old, thin human man with shifty eyes and a sickening, toothy smile. In this form he is known as \"Grinning Jack,\" often shortened to \"Grinjack.\" Gravedragger speaks in a high, mad voice, and is prone to outbursts of cackling even when cloaked by <i>invisibility</i>.  Divinations by the faithful show that Gravedragger was once a mortal farmer. When his wife and family fell ill with a sickness, he traveled to the nearest village to get aid from the healer. When he returned with a curative potion, he found that his home had been struck by lightning and burned to the ground; his family, too sick to crawl out, had perished in the fire. The man's mind snapped, broken by the idea that he could have prevented his loved ones' random and pointless deaths if he hadn't been away from home. He embraced the cult of Zyphus and began studying magic, using his abilities to stalk and kill clerics of rival faiths as well as to ambush adventurers to <i>slay</i> them in their sleep or after difficult battles. After a long, successful life at this morbid career, he died in his sleep, and in Zyphus's realm he was infused with <i>divine</i> power and became the god's herald. Remorseless and vindictive, Gravedigger now enjoys his role as the bringer of bad luck and the foil of fate, and every    death he causes buries a little bit deeper the guilt he feels for his family's deaths.  Although Gravedragger enjoys lurking in graveyards, where he can easily use his bury alive ability, he isn't a harbinger of deserved deaths and is bored by the idea of dispatching wounded soldiers-something he feels is the job of psychopomps. Instead, Gravedragger revels in unexpected methods of murder, such as causing a fallen armored knight to drown in a couple inches of mud after being pulled from his horse.  The herald uses <i>invisibility</i> and greater <i>invisibility</i> to sneak up on his targets and aff lict them with curses or blindness, blow them off cliffs (with <i>gust of wind</i> or <i>telekinesis</i>), call sudden bolts of lightning, or create symptomless deaths (using <i><i>slay</i> living</i>). He might attack from <i>invisibility</i> for 1 or 2 rounds, then leave if he fails to kill anyone quickly-his interest is in spontaneity and sudden death, not extended battle. He usually employs these tactics even if tasked with <i>slay</i>ing a specific person, as it's more entertaining to him to set up an elaborate ambush than to confront his opponent directly. Sometimes he's content to just follow his prey unobserved, creepily breaking the silence with his tittering laugh and unnerving the victim so much that it stumbles into a natural trap or flees in terror toward a wild creature's lair.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Created from a mortal soul and raised to his station by a god, Gravedragger is sustained by <i>divine</i> power and like other outsiders has no need to eat or drink. However, he has often been seen hovering over a dead or dying victim, inhaling deeply as if sucking out remnants of the mortal's soul. He claims these breaths sustain him in place of food or air, but there's no evidence that he actually needs to do this; the habit is probably just some perverse torture intended to unnerve his victims in their last moments. When in his Grinjack form, he often pretends to be a Pharasmin priest, administering false last rites to doomed mortals just to enjoy the sound of their death rattles.  While Gravedragger's physical body appears to be composed of nonliving materials, he's a living creature and this appearance is only his outer \"skin.\" When damaged, he bleeds red blood, pungent yellow bile, and-if the wound is large enough-dismembered humanoid body parts such as hands, limbs, and heads. As he doesn't eat, these parts are probably physical manifestations of the countless lives he has taken in the name of Zyphus. Immortal and able to recover from severe wounds, he would rather escape a fight than allow himself to die, for he has felt death as a mortal and has no desire to repeat the experience.   <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Gravedragger spends most of his time in Zyphus' realm in Abaddon, exchanging grisly stories with the souls of Zyphus's faithful and other <i>divine</i> servitors. Left unsupervised to perform whatever murderous mischief he pleases, Gravedragger visits Golarion to enact petty revenge, blasphemous murders, and countless \"accidental\" deaths.  The herald sometimes associates with various daemons who help him effect these structured accidents, particularly hydrodaemons (death by drowning), leukodaemons (death by plague), meladaemons (death by starvation and thirst), and crucidaemons (death by traps). In the mortal world, Gravedragger has a fondness for pugwampis and trickster fey, especially bogeymen, and has been known to guide their efforts or even transport them over long distances to save them from extermination or help them to find new victims. He sometimes sneaks into a city in his Grinjack form carrying a sack of pugwampis and releases them upon an unsuspecting urban population, cackling glee as he watches the aftermath.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Iron_Gods.jpg","_id":"ZhzJiLnMWbrvTVvI"}

It does not provoke attacks of opportunity with its integrated laser rifle when using combined arms.  </p><p><strong>Efficient Grappler (Ex)</strong> A reclamation robot takes only a -10 penalty on its combat maneuver check to make and maintain a grapple on a foe when using only its claw rather than its whole body to grapple. It receives a +8 bonus on combat maneuver checks to start and maintain a grapple rather than the normal +4 bonus granted by the grab ability. A reclamation robot can make an attack with its integrated laser rifle against one creature it is grappling as a swift action-when it attacks in this way, the robot has a threat range of 18-20 for critical hits with the laser rifle.  </p><p><strong>Item Creation (Ex)</strong> Reclamation robots are known for their startling creativity in repairing damaged technology. A reclamation robot ignores all of the item creation feat requirements for creating a technological item, but must have access to a sufficient amount of scrap metal and spare parts in order to create or repair an item (the robot must still expend materials equal to the item's cost). A reclamation robot can attempt a Knowledge (engineering) check to restore a timeworn technological item to full functionality-the DC of this check is equal to the item's Craft DC + 5, and requires an expenditure of technological components worth a total amount of money equal to the timeworn item's cost (half the cost of the object in its pristine condition). Failure results in the destruction of the item. When a reclamation robot restores a technological  item to full functionality in this manner, if the robot exceeds its DC by a result of 10 or more, it improves the item in some way-choose one of the following improvements or determine one randomly.  </p><ul><li> The item's capacity permanently increases by 50%.  </li><li> If the item is a weapon or armor, it becomes masterwork.  </li><li> The item becomes hardened (increase its hardness by 2).  </li><li> The item becomes fortified (increase its hit points by 50%).  </li><li> The item becomes lightweight (weight is divided in half).  <p><strong>Force Field (Ex)</strong> A reclamation robot is sheathed in a thin layer of shimmering energy that grants it 50 bonus hit points. All damage dealt to a reclamation robot with an active force field is deducted from these hit points first. As long as the force field is active, the reclamation robot is immune to critical hits. A reclamation robot's force field has fast healing 10, but once these hit points are reduced to 0, the force field shuts down and does not reactivate for 24 hours.  </p><p><strong>Integrated Laser Rifle (Ex)</strong> A reclamation robot has a built-in laser rifle in its chest. This weapon has a range of 150 feet and deals 2d6 points of fire damage on a hit. The weapon can fire once per round as a ranged touch attack. A laser attack can pass through force fields and force effects, such as a <i>wall of force</i>, to strike a foe beyond without damaging that field. Objects like glass or other transparent barriers don't provide cover from lasers, but unlike force barriers, a transparent physical barrier still takes damage when a laser passes through it. Invisible creatures and objects are immune to damage from lasers. Fog, smoke, and other clouds provide cover in addition to concealment from laser attacks. Darkness (magical or otherwise) has no effect on lasers other than providing concealment.  </p><p><strong>Salvage (Ex)</strong> A reclamation robot is designed specifically to salvage technology for further use. All Craft skills are class skills for reclamation robots, and they gain a +4 racial bonus on Knowledge (engineering) checks and gain Technologist as a bonus feat. A reclamation robot can repair 2d6 points of damage to a robot within reach (including itself) as a standard action.  </p><p><strong>Scaling (Ex)</strong> Reclamation robots are expected to work at great heights or while clinging to immense ships. They gain a +4 racial bonus on Climb checks. Once every 1d4 rounds, a reclamation robot can increase its climb speed to 40 feet as a swift action for 1 round.  </p><p><strong>Vulnerable to Critical Hits (Ex)</strong> Like all robots, reclamation robots are vulnerable to critical hits. In addition, when a critical hit is confirmed against a reclamation robot, roll a d8. On a roll of 1, instead of suffering additional damage from the critical hit, the robot suffers damage to essential processing units and memory modules that it cannot itself repair (although another reclamation robot could repair this damage). While such damage is not readily apparent on the exterior-and the robot itself is essentially  unaware of it-this kind of injury can have a number of different effects. When such an injury occurs, roll d% and consult the following chart to determine the nature of the damage.  </p><p>   </p><table><tbody><tr><th>d%</th><th>Result</th></tr><tr><td>01-20</td><td>The robot takes a -4 penalty on all skill checks.</td></tr><tr><td>21-30</td><td>The robot's integrated laser rifle now glitches each time it is fired as if it were timewornTG.</td></tr><tr><td>31-40</td><td>The robot loses its scaling ability (including its bonus on Climb checks).</td></tr><tr><td>41-60</td><td>When it attempts to repair damage to a robot via salvage, it only repairs 1d4 points of damage.</td></tr><tr><td>61-70</td><td>Movement is reduced by 10 feet.</td></tr><tr><td>71-95</td><td>One of the robot's claw attacks becomes nonfunctional.</td></tr><tr><td>96-100</td><td>The robot goes berserk, functioning as if under the simultaneous effects of a confusion spell and a rage spell.</td></tr></tbody></table>   </li></ul></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Reclamation robots, or \"reclamators,\" are masters of salvage and construction. These robots were originally designed to build structures and repair all manner of technology with speed and precision. Construction of these robots was difficult and time consuming, but they often repaid those spent resources swiftly with their ability to rebuild and repair other robots or technological items. Their truly remarkable programing surprised even those who originally developed them, as these machines can salvage items thought to be far beyond hope of repair.  Over time it's not uncommon for a reclamation robot to develop a unique personality akin to that of an artist, with something that almost approaches pride in its work. On some occasions, reclamation robots have even been known to make improvements to items and constructs that they repair.  Though a reclamation robot is generally quite adept at repairing damage to itself as well, injury to certain processors and memory modules deep within the robot can cause significant problems. Some of the resulting malfunctions can be quite noticeable (see the table above), while others are subtler, such as a tendency to add baroque and unnecessary embellishments to constructions and repairs. Reclamation robots with this type of damage are largely unaware of their condition and actively resist efforts to repair them, requiring intervention with a robojackTG or the like. There are even recorded incidents of damaged reclamators going rogue and setting off on their own to build whatever outlandish structures their flawed processors dictate. Though they were originally designed to create things for humanoids, such rogue robots typically design structures and devices of no apparent use to organic beings... which isn't to say that these creations don't have a place in some unknowable automaton agenda.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Iron_Gods.jpg","_id":"cQfPO4MtMITm8m1G"}

This container functions somewhat like a suit of armor for the shipmind. A shipmind container has hardness 10 and 240 hit points, and can be damaged by sunder attempts. A shipmind container that gains the broken quality grants only a +5 armor bonus to the  shipmind within, and does not allow the shipmind to heal negative levels gained during a prolonged period outside of the container (see Limited Mobility). The partially crystalline nature of a shipmind container makes it vulnerable to <i>shatter</i> spells, and sonic damage bypasses the container's hardness and inflicts full damage.  </p><p><strong>Immerse (Ex)</strong> When a shipmind in its container successfully grabs a Large or smaller target with one of its slam attacks, it can attempt to drag that target into its body as a swift action. To immerse a creature, the shipmind must attempt a combat maneuver check (as though attempting to pin the opponent). If it succeeds, the prey is pulled into the container with the shipmind and immediately takes 6d6 points of plasma damage (half of which is electricity and half of which is fire) and 1d4 points of Intelligence damage-a successful DC 24 Fortitude save halves the plasma damage and negates the Intelligence damage. A creature that remains immersed takes this damage again every following round at the start of the shipmind's turn. In addition, an immersed creature is in danger of suffocating. A creature can attempt to escape immersion by making a successful combat maneuver check or Escape Artist check, as if it were attempting to escape a pin. If the shipmind's container has the broken condition, attempts to escape in this manner gain a +8 bonus.  </p><p><strong>Limited Mobility (Ex)</strong> Unlike most oozes, a shipmind cannot exist outside of the partially organic container it was originally created in-this container serves the shipmind as its \"skin.\" While inside its container, a shipmind has a speed of 0 feet. When it leaves its container, it gains a speed of 10 feet, but loses its armor bonus to AC. A shipmind can exist outside of its container for 1 hour without consequences, but at the start of each subsequent hour it gains 1 negative level as its body starts to dissolve. These negative levels cannot be restored by any means save by returning to an appropriate shipmind container, at which point they are removed at a rate of 1 level per hour.  </p><p><strong>Plasma Bolt (Su)</strong> As a standard action, a shipmind can fire a bolt of plasma at a target within 300 feet (no range increment). On a hit, a blast of plasma deals 10d6 damage, half of which is electricity damage and half of which is fire damage.  </p><p><strong>Ship Interface (Ex)</strong> As long as a shipmind is interfaced with a Dominion vessel, it can observe events within the ship or within 90 feet of its exterior hull as if via <i>clairaudience/ clairvoyance</i> for as long as the shipmind concentrates. While concentrating on an area, the shipmind can activate traps or other ship systems in the area as a swift action; it can even converse with creatures in the area by vibrating the metal and strange membranes in the walls.  </p><p><strong>Thought Disruption (Su)</strong> The substance that makes up a shipmind ooze is charged with alien psychic energy that is toxic to the minds of most life forms. A creature who  willfully touches an ooze (via a touch attack, natural weapon attack, or unarmed strike) or is struck by its slam attack must make a DC 22 Will save or take 1d4 points of Intelligence damage. This is a mind-affecting <i>confusion</i> effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>The enigmatic shipminds are painstakingly engineered creations of Dominion fleshfarms, molded and formed over the course of years to pilot the massive organic spacecraft the aliens use to navigate the Dark Tapestry.  Intimately bound to their vessels, shipminds oversee the health and function of the ships they control. They maintain this single-minded task for as long as a thousand years before they must be recycled and rebuilt.  A shipmind resides within a specially designed containers on a craft, connected to the ship's greater workings via varying forms of physical interface. These oozes generally follow orders from superiors stationed on their spacecraft, though coaxing is sometimes necessary in order to get these strange creatures to follow direct orders. This is due in part to the fact that these engineered creatures are fanatically devoted to the Dominion's inscrutable faith, with rigid beliefs regarding orthodoxy. Rumors persist of especially radical shipmind oozes going beyond defiance and actually slaying their passengers, a task made frightfully easy due to the mastery each ooze has over every aspect of its spacecraft's function (such as life support and internal security appendages and creatures). Some have been known to plunge their vessel into a star or black hole in moments of defiance or religious ecstasy, leaving the rest of the ship's crew helpless and unable to convince the shipmind to abandon its actions.  As a shipmind reaches more advanced age, it becomes increasingly pedantic and difficult to control. Such oozes often demand small offerings, sacrifices of lesser creatures, or the powering down of ship's systems they deem superf luous or \"unpure.\" At a certain point, the shipmind is recycled, poured from its container into vats to serve as nutrients for the cultivation of a replacement. Fragments of the previous shipmind's intellect and skills carry over into the newly created ooze, ensuring that a sort of entrenched memory and institutional knowledge persist through the generations.  <br /><strong>Deteriorating Shipmind (CR-1)</strong><br />  In cases where a shipmind isn't recycled in time, as often happens in abandoned ships or in cases where a Dominion crew neglects the shipmind for too long,  a shipmind can begin to deteriorate while still within its container. Deteriorated shipminds are sometimes encountered on Dominion drop ships after the vessel has landed on a planet and been left to rot. In such cases, the shipmind slowly goes insane, serving almost as a sort of living haunt within the decaying ship and bringing madness and pain to any creatures exploring its decks. Most deteriorating shipminds survive for only a few years, or a decade at most-in the majority of cases, the Dominion drop ship decays into filth and sludge long before then.  A shipmind that is deteriorating has slightly different statistics than the typical shipmind. You can create stats for one of these shipminds by applying the deteriorating shipmind simple template to the statistics above. The quick rules and rebuild rules for a deteriorating shipmind are the same.  <br /><strong>Quick/Rebuild Rules:</strong> -2 on all rolls (including damage rolls) and to special ability DCs. The shipmind's container is broken and has only 120 hit points. A deteriorating shipmind can only use its plasma bolt once every other round, and gains negative levels at a rate of 1 per round immediately after it leaves its container.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Iron_Gods.jpg","_id":"eL1kcqSR25K1Ti8s"}

As the target mentally regresses, it also becomes more feral and violent. A target that has taken at least 4 points of Intelligence damage from a thorgothrel gains a +2 enhancement bonus to Strength. If a thorgothrel spends an hour experimenting on a target rendered unconscious due to Intelligence damage, it can make this regression permanent. Thereafter, the target's Intelligence score is reduced to 1. This regression can be reversed only with <i>heal</i>, <i>limited <i>wish</i></i>, <i>miracle</i>, or <i>wish</i>. At the GM's discretion, the target might change in additional ways to reflect its atavistic regression.  </p><p><strong>Force Field (Ex)</strong> A thorgothrel with a silver armature is sheathed in a thin layer of shimmering energy that grants 40 bonus hit points. All damage dealt to a thorgothrel with an active force field is reduced from these hit points first. As long as the force field is active, the thorgothrel is immune to critical hits. A thorgothrel's force field has fast healing 10, but once its hit points are reduced to 0, the force field shuts down and can only be reactivated if the thorgothrel spends a full-round action and succeeds at a DC 15 Disable Device check. If successful, the force field reactivates with 1 hit point.  </p><p><strong>Force Ray (Ex)</strong> As a standard action, a thorgothrel can lose 5 hit points from its force field (if it has that many or more remaining) in order to fire a ray of force at any target within 100 feet. The ray is a ranged touch attack that deals 10d6 points of force damage.  </p><p><strong>Poisonous Sublimation (Ex)</strong> When a thorgothrel without an active force field is in a region with breathable atmosphere, it beings to evaporate into a poisonous mist. The thorgothrel takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage each round at the beginning of its turn, and the mist expands to fill a 20-foot radius. Any living creature in the mist with 6 or fewer HD must succeed at a DC 17 Fortitude save or be slain. A creature with more than 6 HD takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage each round while in the mist (Fortitude half). A moderate wind disperses the mist in 4 rounds; a strong wind disperses the mist in 1 round. This is a poison effect, and the save DC is Constitution-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Thorgothrels are a spacefaring race of aggressive genetic manipulators. In their natural form, thorgothrels are blobs of protoplasm 12 feet in diameter that move with awkward undulation. Thorgothrels can extrude pseudopods in order to manipulate objects and form simple tools. These pseudopods excrete a complex cocktail of chemicals that can force changes to a victim's underlying genetic structure.  Weighed down by Golarion's gravity and quick to sublimate into poisonous vapor in the atmosphere, thorgothrels find Golarion (and similar planets) inherently inimical. A thorgothrel can move about on Golarion only by wrapping its body around a frame of silver rods that provides inner support and encases the creature in a resilient force field barrier. Despite the hazard Golarion's atmosphere poses to these alien creatures, the planet's staggering diversity of life presents a veritable cornucopia of beings upon which they can perform their genetic experimentations, inching closer to their goal of returning all creatures to a primeval, atavistic state.  The silver armature largely determines the exact size of a thorgothrel, but a typical thorgothrel stands around 11 feet tall and weighs about 900 lbs.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Hailing from a distant planet with a radically different environment, thorgothrels don't fit into Golarion's ecosystem. The environment on Golarion is deadly to this spacefaring race, as the planet's comparatively low   air pressure causes them to vaporize when exposed to it. Thorgothrels on Golarion combat this by remaining continually sheathed in a protective force field to avoid fatal dematerialization. Even in the best of conditions, a thorgothrel moves slowly. On Golarion, it must wrap its protoplasmic form around an artificial skeleton in order to move at a speed greater than a crawl. Thorgothrel mathematics are based on a ternary system, which is ref lected in their armatures usually having three legs and three arms radially placed around a central spine.  Thorgothrels feed on electrical currents and certain metals. The armatures thorgothrels create in order to provide mobility are made of electromagnetically charged and refined silver, and thus contain all of the nutrients the creatures need to survive for several months. Without an armature, a thorgothrel requires an ounce of silver per week to survive. Thorgothrels don't require true sleep, and the torpor they enter in the long years of travel between planets in their strange ships provides them with sufficient rest to remain active for months at a time.  Thorgothrels communicate telepathically, and consider verbal communication to be the sort of anathema that drives their work toward retrogressive development.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  The thorgothrel race were once humanoids. The greatest of their scientists and philosophers concluded that evolutionary advancement was a danger to the universe as a whole, and that life in its most primitive state was safest for all creatures. The thorgothrels began a great spacefaring crusade to subjugate other planets and force regressive evolution on the planets' denizens via genetic manipulation. Thorgothrels take pride in devolving entire planets into primitive life forms, and slaughter those races that put up too much of a struggle against their \"great work.\"  As the thorgothrels \"improved\" world after world, they also manipulated their own genes. While maintaining their intelligence and skill at genetic manipulation, the race regressed its form to that of sentient blobs of protoplasm. Thorgothrels buttress the weaknesses of these new bodies, such as low mobility, with technological solutions. Although silver armatures and defensive force fields are the most common artifacts of thorgothrel science, rumors from other worlds tell of thorgothrels that occupy gargantuan walking machines or psychic field projectors powerful enough to render entire cities docile.  Their great crusade has caused the once numerous thorgothrel race to dwindle, but the race's fervor to enforce regression still continues on many far-f lung planets. A few decades ago, thorgothrel explorers discovered Golarion and were staggered by the abundance of advanced life found on this world. However, Golarion's unfavorable environment and great distance from the thorgothrels' homeworld has so far stymied a full-scale assault. To date, only a few daring adventurer-geneticists have come to Golarion. To avoid attracting wide public attention, these thorgothrels pursue their regression experiments in isolated locations, such as lonely wastelands, border outposts, or hidden valleys. Thorgothrels carefully dissect failed experiments in order to hone their craft, but usually set successfully regressed victims free. Rumors of remote areas where animals or people have suddenly \"gone wild\" or \"turned feral\" may indicate a thorgothrel's presence.  Thorgothrels are arrogant and prone to overconfidence. Most thorgothrels encountered on Golarion have visited dozens of other worlds, and they consider even the most advanced of Golarion's creatures to be evolutionary mistakes that must be corrected or exterminated. This gives thorgothrels little reason to communicate with other races, which in turn feeds into their intellectual and philosophical mandate to act however they see fit.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Iron_Gods.jpg","_id":"fXppinpiSZW2DOK0"}

These communal animals live in vast tunneling colonies like ants, each working endlessly to provide for the warren. They dig tunnels and burrows, shoring up the sides of the passages with sticky saliva that hardens into a temporary cement. Since they constantly toil in their warrens, their tawny fur collects fine dust and sand particles.

His first attack in a round is always a sunder attempt, as he knows that a foe deprived of a weapon is easier to defeat.</p><p><strong>Morale </strong>While raging, Kevoth-Kul fights to the death. The Black Sovereign is a proud and arrogant man, but he has also grown tired of his role as puppet leader of Starfall. If he is captured alive (or reduced to 15 or fewer hit points while not raging), he throws down his weapons and demands in an uncharacteristically weary voice for his victors to finish him off. He is not interested in becoming a prisoner of yet another group, and if he gets the impression that the PCs want to keep him alive, he'll attack again, hoping to earn a final death in combat.

The Black Sovereign's long addiction to these fluids has resulted in a tolerance to their effects, but he's constantly in a state of mild delirium and takes a -5 penalty on Perception checks and Sense Motive checks, as well as a -2 penalty on saving throws against mind-affecting effects. Curing his addiction is a difficult task because of the length of time he's spent addicted to the fluids. His current addiction is severe, with a save DC of 40 due to his continued exposure to the drugs. <i>Remove disease</i> can cure his addiction with a successful DC 40 caster level check. <i>Heal</i> automatically cures his addiction. If cured of his addiction, the Black Sovereign loses the penalties detailed above, along with the current side effects he's under-he doesn't lose his bonuses to Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution or his immortality, though, as these are permanent effects (see Side Effects, below). If cured of his addiction, the Black Sovereign may become a potent ally of the PCs against the Technic League- or he might immediately attack them-see Campaign Role below to determine his reaction to being cured.  </p><p><strong>Side Effects (Ex)</strong> Over time, the Black Sovereign's exposure to <i>Numeria</i>n fluids has resulted in a permanent +2 increase to his Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores. Perhaps more impressively, the fluids have granted him immortality: Kevoth-Kul takes no penalties from aging effects and won't die from old age. Each time the PCs encounter the Black  Sovereign, roll randomly on the <i>Numeria</i>n Fluids table on page 29 of <i>Pathfinder Campaign Setting</i>: <i>Numeria</i>, <i>Land of Fallen Stars</i> to determine what additional effect the man is experiencing at that particular time, re-rolling results of 01 or 100. If you aren't using that book, instead roll d%. On a result of 01-75, Kevoth-Kul is sickened; on a result of 76-100, he gains fast healing 5.</p></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Iron_Gods.jpg","_id":"myABtChyhE1M49ar"}

Damage dealt to the robot is applied to the force field first. As long as the field is active, the robot is immune to critical hits. The force field has fast healing 8, but once the field's hit points are reduced to 0, the field collapses and does not reactive for 24 hours.  </p><p><strong>Interrogate (Ex)</strong> As a standard action, the torturer robot can attempt a Heal check to deal 1d4 points of damage to an ability of its choice possessed by an adjacent, helpless target.

The nanites produce one of the following effects or conditions (CL 10th, where applicable): <i>cure serious wounds</i>, <i>lesser restoration</i>, <i>neutralize poison</i>, <i>remove disease</i>, exhaustion, nauseated for 1d4 rounds, or paralyzed (nauseated targets only, for remainder of original duration). If the victim succeeds at a DC 17 Fortitude saving throw, exhaustion is reduced to fatigue, nauseated is reduced to sickened, and other effects are negated.

Lasers pass through transparent creatures and objects without causing harm (including force fields, force effects, and invisible creatures; it can pass through glass, but the glass takes damage), and can strike targets behind them normally.

The bionanite cloud can maintain this effect each round after initial activation as a move action. This is a visual mind-affecting effect.

The cloud can administer this healing in an instant before resolving any actual damage dealt to prevent a creature's death from its swarm attack.  </p><p><strong>Weakness (Ex)</strong> When a bionanite cloud damages a living creature, it disrupts the transmission of nerve impulses to the creature's muscles, causing 1d4 points of Strength damage.

The fur of petromins is awash in sapphire-blue bioluminescence, unnoticeable during the day but distinctive from dusk until dawn. Petromins have control over this natural light, which allows them to attract the large insects on which they feed.

A surgeon robot's force field has fast healing 15, but once these bonus hit points are reduced to 0, the force field shuts down and doesn't reactivate for 24 hours.  </p><p><strong>Master Surgeon (Ex)</strong> Programmed to execute advanced medical procedures, a surgeon robot can perform surgeries and other procedures that heal humanoid creatures of all manner of maladies. A surgeon robot can heal wounds, set broken bones, cure diseases, treat burns, remove poison, and even install cybertech items. These procedures take varying amounts of time for the surgeon robot to complete and require different Heal check DCs. The DCs for these surgical procedures increase by 10 when they're performed on a non-humanoid creature. These procedures leave the patient with the exhausted condition. If the surgeon robot fails any of its Heal checks, the surgery fails and the patient takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage and is exhausted for 24 hours. The procedures a surgeon robot can perform are as follows:  </p><ul><li> Cure Blindness/Deafness (DC 35): The patient's sight or hearing is restored. <i>Required Time</i>: 30 minutes.  </li><li> Install Cybertech (DC = 5 + the cybertech install <i>DC)</i>: Cybernetic equipment is installed safely. <i>Required Time</i>: 20 minutes per point of implantation of the cybertech being installed.  </li><li> Minor Surgery (DC 25): The patient is healed of 1d8+1 points of damage. <i>Required Time</i>: 5 minutes.  </li><li> Moderate Surgery (DC 30): The patient is healed of 2d8+3 points of damage and 1d4+1 points of ability damage to a selected ability score. <i>Required Time</i>: 10 minutes.  </li><li> Major Surgery (DC 35): The patient is healed of 3d8+5 points of damage and is cured of blindness and deafness. <i>Required Time</i>: 15 minutes.  </li><li> Critical Surgery (DC 40): The patient is healed of 4d8+7 points of damage and either all ability damage to all ability scores or all ability drain to one ability score. <i>Required Time</i>: 30 minutes.  </li><li> Treat Toxin (DC = 10 + the save <i>DC of disease or poison)</i>: One disease or poison currently afflicting the patient is removed. <i>Required Time</i>: 10 minutes.  <p><strong>Specialized Programming (Ex)</strong> Heal is always a class skill for surgeon robots, and they gain a +8 racial bonus on Heal checks.  </p><p><strong>Superior Optics (Ex)</strong> Surgeon robots see invisible creatures or objects as if they were visible.  </p><p><strong>Syringe (Ex)</strong> When a surgeon robot makes a successful attack with its syringe, it can inject the target with pharmaceuticals.

The surgeon robot can choose to affect its target with cardioamp, cureall, hemochem (grade III), torpinal, or zortaphen each time it uses this ability. Rules for these pharmaceuticals can be found on pages 33-34 of <i>Pathfinder Campaign Setting</i>: <i>Technology Guide</i>.</p></li></ul></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>These large, insectoid-looking robots were designed to perform incredibly complicated surgeries with flawless results. Possessing a data bank filled with advanced surgical techniques, these robots produce nearly supernatural effects, and the recovery time from their procedures is often nothing short of miraculous. These robots were  originally stationed on <i>Divinity</i> to care for the humanoid crew of the ship during their long voyage, and some were even employed to treat the aliens the ship collected during its journey. Surgeon robots stand 7 feet tall and weigh a bit more than 600 pounds.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Formed from a skeletal array of gleaming metal, surgeon robots can contort their forms to accommodate various positions needed to most effectively perform surgical procedures on their patients. Though the robot is capable of standing upright and extending its body to a height of 10 feet, it usually stands on four legs when working for increased stability. In this posture, the surgeon robot resembles an oversized preying mantis. Surgeon robots are equipped with powerful and precise rotors that allow them to fly if necessary. This added movement allows surgeon robots to treat patients in precarious locations during emergency situations.  Surgeon robots possess remarkable speed, dexterity, and structural strength, and their design makes them highly adaptable. In addition to sensory inputs that exceed the senses of most living creatures, its creators also added a nanite-powered pharmaceutical lab that is housed deep in the robot's body. Each of its limbs-though seemingly delicate-is crafted from remarkably durable metal that flexes to prevent breakage if the robot attempts to lift more than it can normally carry. Thin claws extend from its two primary limbs, allowing it to deftly and precisely maneuver a patient into the optimal position for each of the dizzying number of procedures the robot is capable of performing. Should a surgeon robot need to defend itself or its patient, its claws are also more than ample weapons.  Some surgeon robots have been reprogrammed to accommodate different sorts of patients. Due to exposure to alien creatures or training given by those expecting to venture into places with non-humanoid creatures, the robots contain detailed information on alien physiologies. These surgeon robots can perform surgical procedures on non-humanoid creatures with no increase to the Heal DC.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  The Technic League has spent a great deal of effort recovering and reprogramming these robots for its own purposes, which are not limited to simple healing and surgery. Aside from medicine, Technic League agents use these robots as torturers during painful interrogations, or take advantage of the robots' pharmaceutical production to keep subjects drugged for months at a time. Despite such alternate uses, these intelligent constructs have a hardwired directive that Technic League agents have failed to deactivate: an obsessive  drive to perfect their craft. Surgeon robots continually attempt to study humanoid physiology. They require new subject matter to study with some regularity, and if denied such opportunities, they take it upon themselves to collect specimens and perform experiments on them-sometimes claiming the same Technic League agents who tried to cow them.  These robots are most commonly encountered in Silver Mount, among the Technic League compound in Starfall, or hidden away inside other ruins of <i>Divinity</i>'s crash where they once were stationed to provide medical care. However, rogue surgeon robots may also be found in dungeons or caves that they've transformed into their own macabre operating rooms filled with all manner of strange and alien technological devices. On rare occasions, these beings form pacts with other intelligent creatures, bartering their services as surgeons in return for both materials and test subjects. Lacking any sort of conscience or ethical code, surgeon robots make excellent torturers and executioners.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Iron_Gods.jpg","_id":"wuOpG2IiZWqUnJyj"}

They carry out their orders with ruthlessness and zeal, usually offering no warning before attacking a perceived threat. The Technic League has had moderate success in controlling a few of these robots, and occasionally assigns them as guards for valuable treasures or important prisoners, roles for which they're well suited.  Although the mere sight of these massive machines is imposing enough to ward off most intruders, those who are undeterred by a warden's appearance soon find the robot to be quite capable of destroying those who enter its territory without proper clearance. Unlike golems or similarly mindless constructs, wardens possess an intelligence that allows them to employ tactics, either on their own or as part of a unit. When acting in groups, the robots are smart enough to suppress and reactivate their nausea-inducing sound waves in concert, maximizing the length of time their opponents are incapacitated.  Most wardens are in Silver Mount, but some can be found in many other parts of Numeria. Nearly all share the same characteristics: a squat upper body with a domed shape and two arms ending in six surprisingly dexterous \"fingers\" surrounding emitters that serve as its primary ranged weapons. Two stout, multi-jointed legs provide the construct with great mobility, even on hilly or rough terrain.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Wardens were obviously designed and programmed to guard objects, people, or locations. Although they have no life cycle to speak of, these robots do seem to possess certain behavioral characteristics that make them fascinating to Numerian scholars.  The warden's reactive armor is a matter of particular interest to the Technic League. Although the robots are still vulnerable to critical hits, their armor reduces the risk posed by this weakness. A few of the League's most talented members have devoted themselves to determining how the reactive armor works and how to replicate it. The secret appears to be in the material that comprises the robot's exoskeleton-which behaves like metal in all respects until struck by a powerful force, when it responds with a violent, fiery explosion. Amazingly, the explosive material restores itself over time, as long as the robot continues to function.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Wardens, like many robots found in Numeria, follow strict internal programming that guides their actions. Their special programming, however, is somewhat more flexible than that of other robots. Wardens learn and adapt, especially when it comes to facing specialized types of foes.  As constructs built by ancient masters whose goals and intentions are almost unknowable, wardens have no   society in the traditional sense of the word. They exist only to follow their programming to the best of their ability. Still, their ability to adapt and work together in small groups makes them formidable opponents for those who would seek treasures in the ancient caches scattered throughout Numeria.  Although capable of speech, wardens communicate with each other by some other means. They coordinate efforts silently, and skillfully arrange patrols to maximize coverage of their assigned areas. As long as a warden is guarding something (whether by itself or as part of a group of wardens), it nearly always follows the orders of the creature that owns the object or location. Wardens demonstrate a clear understanding of their duties, and can apply their alien intelligence toward problem solving when the situation requires it. This makes them effective jailers as well, since they can use their incapacitating sound field against prisoners who attempt to escape-as well as on those who might try to break the prisoners out.  <br /><strong>Wardens of Note</strong><br /> Wardens appear to have been an apex design, for the same model has been found guarding many of the chambers in Silver Mount, as well as other scattered remnants of the massive vessel that fell from the sky so long ago. However, a few have been known to display different characteristics. Some of these alterations are intentional modifications made by people with great knowledge and skill. Other models may have even stranger origins.  <br /><strong>Red Terror (N warden robot ranger 7):</strong> The robot known as Red Terror guards a section of tunnels within the Red Redoubt of Karamoss. Red Terror appears to have been crafted using an alloy of djezet and steel (known as djezeteel). It's unclear whether the mad wizard Karamoss created the specialized warden robot using deciphered schematics or merely modified an existing construct. Either way, Red Terror is a skilled and ruthless hunter that relentlessly pursues intruders in its domain. Those adventurers who have encountered Red Terror claim that the robot actually seems to take pleasure in the gruesome deaths of its prey. The robot also seems to have some way to empower spellcasters it allies with and enhance the power of their spells.  <br /><strong>Silent Sentinel (CR 9):</strong> Explorers investigating ruins in the Felldales of western Numeria have reported encountering a unique version of the warden robot that can generate fields that cancel sound rather than induce nausea, earning it the name \"Silent Sentinel.\" This aura has the effect of a <i>silence</i> spell with a 30-foot radius centered on the warden, but the effect can't be dispelled or countered by magic. Instead of sonic disruptors, Silent Sentinel is equipped with integrated lasers that deal 2d8 points of fire damage. Based on recent reports from near the First Blade's Path, this specialized warden doesn't keep to just the Felldales.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Iron_Gods.jpg","_id":"xm8P25MwHQPIHJFm"}

The save DC is Constitution-based.  </p><p><strong>Oversized Pincer (Ex)</strong> A gammenore's pincer attack is a primary attack that deals the indicated amount of damage plus 1-1/2 times its Strength modifier.  </p><p><strong>Shell of Ice (Su)</strong> Much of a gammenore's carapace is encased in a thick layer of jagged icicles. This shell of ice functions much like spiked armor, dealing 1d8 points of piercing damage to the target of any successful grapple combat maneuver check made by the gammenore.  Additionally, this frozen shell helps to regulate the gammenore's cold body temperature, granting it resistance 10 to fire. The shell can absorb up to 60 points of fire damage before melting. Once the shell melts, the gammenore takes a -4 penalty to its natural armor bonus, it loses its fire resistance, and it deals no additional damage when grappling. A gammenore can reconstitute a melted shell by spending time in areas of intense cold. This process takes 2 hours in a cold environment, 3d10 minutes in areas of severe cold, and 1d10 minutes in areas of extreme cold.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>The gammenore is a prime example of how Triaxian fauna has adapted to survive the planet's long, cruel winters. While other creatures struggle to survive the planet's decades-long season of cold and ice, the gammenore thrives, turning the might of winter into the very tools of its survival.  Absent its icy armor, the gammenore looks like a large, blue-and-white-shelled crustacean. It has a rather wide,  oval-shaped carapace, a pair of powerful pincers, and four pairs of strong, articulated legs.  A gammenore's two pincers serve very different purposes. The primary claw is monstrously large and extremely strong, and is used to break through ice and crush the gammenore's prey. The other claw is smaller, less cumbersome, and sharp enough to rend flesh and bone. The gammenore uses this smaller claw to tear its victims into pieces small enough to eat, and to perform any manipulations too delicate for the large claw. Its eyes are located on short stalks that rise from the front of its carapace, allowing it to see even when encased in its shell of ice. A gammenore is approximately 8 feet wide, and weighs between 2,000 and 3,000 pounds.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Despite their resemblance to mundane crabs, gammenores are primarily terrestrial creatures, living in water only as larvae and while mating. They can be found anywhere ice and snow exists on Triaxus, from the high mountains to the low snowy plains, or even atop the ice-covered seas. The gammenore is an ambush predator, preferring to conceal itself in snow banks or among ice formations and wait for prey to approach. Once a victim is within reach, the gammenore erupts from hiding and attempts to grab or cripple the target with its large claw. Failing that, it may chase down its prey on foot, especially if the victim seems injured or the terrain favors climbing over sprinting. When times are lean, a gammenore may resort to scavenging or even to stealing food from larger predators, trusting its shell to protect it from enemies' reprisals.  When threatened, a gammenore forces freezing water through pores in its shell to form a barrier of spikes across its carapace. These spikes break and fuse together over time to form a thick sheet of jagged ice over much of the gammenore's body, granting it a second layer of defense against attacks. A gammenore is able to excrete more water this way than it should theoretically be able to carry within its body, leading many scholars to conclude that much of the ice is magically produced or conjured. Despite this, gammenores seem to possess an unquenchable thirst, spending much of their time eating snow and ice. The creatures also prefer to eat their food frozen, letting victims' torn bodies freeze before crunching away at their meals.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  During Triaxus's harsh winters, gammenores rarely spend much time in each other's company, as they are extremely competitive and fight each other for food or territory. Their behavior changes drastically as the season begins to turn- they become much more companionable as winter's grip on the land weakens. As spring nears, gammenores from across Triaxus instinctively begin to migrate to the nearest   body of water to mate and lay their eggs. These eggs then go dormant during the planet's long summer, hatching as the water temperature begins to drop once again. After laying their eggs, gammenores migrate to the coldest, most remote parts of the world. This is a time of danger for the civilized races of Triaxus, for gammenore migration routes are hardly regular each season and often cross through populated areas. In the northern stretches of the Allied Territories, inhabitants tell tales of armies of gammenores, over a hundred strong, marching through cities and leaving naught but rubble and ruin. These stories are most likely exaggerations, as gammenores rarely travel in groups larger than nine, but such packs of migrating gammenores can still wreak havoc on a community.  At the end of the gammenores' journey, they gather by the hundreds atop the tallest mountains and in the deepest caverns of the world to flee the coming heat. Near the planet's north pole these colonies can grow into the thousands, covering swaths of land in a living blanket of gammenores. Piled atop each other, the gammenores extend their ice shells to cover their entire bodies, encasing themselves in ice and slowing their metabolisms in an attempt to preserve themselves. Precipitation during the tail end of winter combines with the gammenore's own supernatural cold to further cement the creatures together, forming miniature glaciers and mountain icecaps to protect the colony from the heat of the planet's long summer.  This defense is far from perfect and few gammenores survive to the next winter. During particularly hot summers, gammenores on the periphery of the colony thaw prematurely. These gammenores either die quickly from the heat, or stumble into glacial runoff and are washed downstream, becoming short-lived menaces to riverside communities. Summertime gammenores react to heat dangers as though they were one category more severe-normal temperatures count as hot conditions, hot conditions count as severe heat, etc. The high temperatures of summer also disorient the gammenores, giving them the confused condition. Gammenores in the heat lose their shell of ice ability entirely, and produce sprays of cold water from their bodies in place of ice spikes, allowing them to attempt a single combat maneuver check to bull rush all adjacent creatures once every 1d4 rounds. Reduce the CR of a gammenore encountered in the summertime by 2.  Gammenore eggs hatch in late fall, releasing swarms of larvae into the waters in which they were deposited. These larvae feed upon each other, and on anything the current washes them across, until they mature into adult gammenores at the start of winter. Meanwhile, the adults that survived the summer chip themselves free from their communal glaciers to seek new hunting grounds away from their competitive kin, so that they can feed and restore their strength.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Iron_Gods.jpg","_id":"yBdJw4TJdqQq8sEu"}
