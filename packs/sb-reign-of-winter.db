This sigil serves as the entrance to the kikimora's tiny domain, where she can live within the house without being detected. Only the kikimora can enter this hidey-hole. Anytime after designating a hidey-hole, the kikimora can transport herself and up to 50 pounds of objects to the hidey-hole as a standard action, as long as she is in the same room as the sigil. The kikimora can exit the hidey-hole in the same way, appearing in the closest empty square to the sigil. Any objects left within the hidey-hole remain there when the kikimora exits the space, even if she removes the sigil and places it in another location. While inside the hidey-hole, the kikimora can see what is going on outside of the space through a special sensor, as if the kikimora were standing where her sigil is placed. As a result, mundane objects placed in front of the sigil can block the kikimora's sight from the hidey-hole.  Zorka has scrawled her sigil in rooms throughout the <i><i><i>Dancing</i> Hut</i> of Baba Yaga</i>, allowing her to enter and exit her hidey-hole from any of the <i><i>Dancing</i> Hut</i>'s configurations. In effect, Zorka has access to every room within the <i><i>Dancing</i> Hut</i>, even those rooms currently inaccessible because of the hut's physical location. Because multiple sigils provide access to Zorka's hidey-hole, removing one of the sigils has no effect on the hidey-hole or any creatures inside it unless all of the sigils within the <i><i>Dancing</i> Hut</i> are removed.</p></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Reign_of_Winter.jpg","_id":"5BHorKtvo4xd5sd0"}

(Most weapons sized for Medium creatures are considered Tiny or Small animated objects.) These weapons must be within 50 feet of the warsworn and are all animated at once. This effect only affects weapons and no other type of object. Each weapon animated by this effect appears to be wielded by ghostly hands. Aside from being able to be individually destroyed or dispelled as per normal animated objects, any object animated by this effect can also be damaged by channel energy as if it were an undead creature. Creatures affected by <i>protection from evil</i> are immune to this effect.

When the slivers reach the heart 1d3 rounds later, the creature takes 1d6 points of Constitution damage. The slivers are destroyed by anything that removes curses, diseases, or death effects. Likewise, creatures immune to curses, diseases, and death effects are immune to this ability.  </p><p><strong>Shrapnel (Ex)</strong> A genthodaemon can shake loose four large pieces of the shrapnel embedded in its body as a standard action (make a separate attack roll for each piece). This attack has a range of 180 feet with no range increment. All targets of this attack must be within 30 feet of each other. The daemon can launch at most 24 pieces of shrapnel in any 24-hour period.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Genthodaemons are common troops of daemonic armies, resolutely obedient to any greater type of daemon that gives them orders. They personify death in hopeless or futile wars, genocide, and the despair created by long, bloody stalemates where the combatants lose their will to live and forget why they were fighting in the first place. They have almost no role in corrupting mortals, as they are devoid of interest in the fates of most other creatures, but are sometimes called by daemonologists or greater daemons for use in war or their ability to shape battlefields. Any daemon that can summon a ceustodaemon can instead use its summon ability to summon a genthodaemon.  A genthodaemon looks like a stereotypical fiend- basically humanoid, but with claws, a tail, batlike wings, and cloven hooves. Metal armored plates, barbs, and spikes cover its body, though these are part of the daemon rather than armor it wears. Its claws are jagged metal shards sprouting from its fingers where nails should be.  Genthodaemons are only slightly above cacodaemons and lacridaemons in the hierarchy of Abaddon. A greater daemon may create a genthodaemon from a cacodaemon or one of the hunted (a dead soul trying to survive on Abaddon); however, most arise naturally from war-battered souls who band together as hunted, transforming into true daemons simultaneously when the group has cannibalized enough souls. Genthodaemons show unusual loyalty to others in their band, though this doesn't interfere with their obligations to more powerful daemons.  A typical genthodaemon stands over 9 feet tall and weighs 500 to 600 pounds (with much of this weight stemming from the daemon's embedded metal).  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Souls that become genthodaemons usually come from worlds where war technology has advanced to allow production of large amounts of metal armor and weapons-particularly worlds where firearms have been invented. When battle grows so such a scope that the enemy becomes a faceless tide, or killing becomes casual and easy at long range, the act of waging war becomes completely dehumanized and soldiers become mere pieces in a perpetual machine. In such grim instances and the seeds are planted to send soldiers' souls to Abaddon.  These ties to the craft of war stain the dead soul and the daemon created from it, manifesting as armor plates fused with daemonic flesh, pieces of weapons embedded in its bones, or even remnants of siege engines or barbed wire sprouting from or wrapped around the daemon's body. These elements are part of the daemon, not mere decorations, but any mechanical pieces merely resemble functional items and no longer work (for example, a daemon with a crossbow or rifle embedded in its arm cannot shoot it). Genthodaemons from the same band often resemble each other, including the shape of their metal parts, sometimes because their mortal selves were even in the same army and uniform.  Though genthodaemons serve in the armies of all four Horsemen, they are most strongly associated with Szuriel, the Horseman of War. Her military background, strong discipline, and focus on the brutality of war resonates with the core of a genthodaemon's being. Those who (as mortals) were involved in acts of genocide have a morbid fascination with obscisidaemons and tend to follow them. Though genthodaemons were not the instigators of genocide in their mortal lives (which could have granted them higher status on Abaddon), those who participated in such acts feel a fawning admiration for the greater daemons who orchestrated such atrocities.  Like other daemons, genthodaemons hate all living things-and to an extent, themselves-and look forward to the death of the last mortal, for on that day they will have no other reminders of their bleak mortal lives and can focus all their hate inward.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Genthodaemons patrol the fortresses, cities, ruins, and wastelands of Abaddon looking for invaders, hostile non-daemons, and gangs of the hunted. Because they usually travel in groups, they are rarely preyed upon by other creatures and only have to face death when deployed as part of a Horseman's army. They are of low status but fulfill a necessary role as soldiers of Abaddon. Greater daemons treat them with the formal respect due their relative difference in rank, much like how a general might treat a common soldier. However, in the wars against mortal life, the Horsemen understand the value of suicidal missions and brazen sacrifice, and are not above sending countless genthodaemons to permanent destruction if it advances the cause of Abaddon. The genthodaemons accept this as their lot and never complain, as protests require effort, will, and the belief that there is a possibility of change-three things these shell-shocked creatures lost long ago.  On the Material Plane, genthodaemons sometimes serve daemonic cults that are unworthy of a greater daemon's attention or lacking the power to summon a more powerful creature. As their magic is suitable for war and destruction, they have limited use to mortal cultists not intent on violence.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Reign_of_Winter.jpg","_id":"AxvAJcHx3nBPQfvZ"}

This always entails a raucous aerial ritual, usually centered on those that wish to make use of this ability. The ritual functions like a <i>teleportation circle</i> (CL 17th), except it requires 1 minute of uninterrupted casting time, the circle doesn't need to be placed on a horizontal surface, and it is not invisible or hard to detect. After coming into existence, the edges of the circle glow and the effect stays in place for 1 minute. Most witchcrows loathe using this power, but some offer it as a service to those in need of quick travel, demanding a high price for such assistance-usually something in the bargainer's possession that is cherished, extremely valuable, and almost always magical.  </p><p><strong>Hexes (Su)</strong> A greater witchcrow uses hexes as a 5th-level witch. Invariably, these abilities include the cackle, evil eye, and misfortune hexes, and require a successful DC 15 Will save to negate or resist. Witchcrow cackling proves especially unnerving as it sounds like extremely mocking cawing.</p><p> See Advanced Player's Guide.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>The dreaded witchcrow, renowned as a harbinger of <i>ill</i> deeds and misfortune, preys on the weak and spies on the unwary. Clever, manipulative, and avaricious in the extreme, these foul birds have no conscience and know no fear. Witchcrows strive to steal not only victims' most cherished possessions, but their hopes and dreams as well. They delight in bringing anguish, sowing doubt even as they feign friendly advice designed to tear down alliances, dupe the gullible, and compromise the virtuous. Despite their deceptive nature, witchcrows can also hold valuable information-or come by such if paid to retrieve it.  Witchcrows value arcane magic above all else, not simply as practitioners-the birds certainly have their own innate talent for witchcraft-but also as collectors. In exchange for their services or valuable information, witchcrows trade for scrolls, potions, and other lesser magic items. Even if such items go unoffered, an intense covetous streak drives witchcrows to pilfer these things if they sense them among a bargainer's possessions. Often, they single out arcane casters as targets for thievery, closing on casters from a distance with their <i>vanish</i> ability and executing flyby attacks to snatch away any baubles they desire. They carry such loot back to their nests to proudly share stories of their daring raids under the preening adulation of their peers. Prolonged spellcasting (casting spells with a casting time greater than 1 round) often attracts witchcrows in the area. They stalk spellcasters in groups, watching for opportunities to steal from them.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Legends claim the first witchcrows spawned in the Dimension of Dreams-hatched from corrupted eggs nurtured by night hags and released onto other planes to carry out misdeeds. Whether this tale is true or not, these birds often keep company with hags. They sometimes treat with more powerful magical beings as messengers, spies, or informants, traveling in groups for mutual protection. Each covey or murder also follows a migratory pattern, moving between sites of power and areas of unusual magic.  Greater witchcrows not only hoard arcane items, but also are dependent on them for reproduction, siphoning away subtle emanations of magical power to aid their gestation process. The likelihood of an egg hatching into a greater witchcrow increases in direct correlation to the time it spends in close proximity to such items. As a result, female witchcrows are much more active in stealing arcane objects for their nests and aggressively fend off rivals to retain any treasure in their possession. Witchcrows can lay a clutch of up to five eggs every year and remain fertile throughout their entire adult lifespan-approximately 20 to 30 years.  As a greater witchcrow nears the end of its life, it experiences an unusual phenomenon called the Dreaming, in which it enters a fugue state lasting nearly a week. During this time, it molts and meditates as it comes to terms with the end of its life and attempts to pinpoint its final resting place. Usually, this is a place it particularly enjoyed in the past. Once the bird determines the location and fixates on it, the remaining members of its group invoke their apportation to send it there as its life's reward. Thereafter, the others argue and bicker over any magic items left behind by the elder witchcrow.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Witchcrows have an affinity for colder climes, and often masquerade as normal crows living in the fields and forests near the civilized settlements of other creatures. They particularly seek out magical societies where they can gain greater access to arcane items. On Golarion, this makes witchcrows most prevalent in Irrisen, where they've developed a terrible reputation-enough so that the witches of Irrisen (and the people they rule) both fear and revile the birds, marking them for destruction whenever they find them.  In witchcrow society, greater witchcrows always establish dominance over their lesser kin, rising to lead large congregations of the malicious birds and shepherding them from one habitat to another. Witchcrows always mutually support one another even as they compete for the same resources, following a strict social hierarchy that aggrandizes the most successful thieves among them. Leaders of any given covey collect and dispense the spoils of their activities, assigning arcane treasures to the strongest of their kind during mating season. Those witchcrows that contribute little to the group's success often find themselves with empty nests during these gatherings-or cast out of the flock entirely.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Reign_of_Winter.jpg","_id":"BvrxdKXQ3OViP1Cg"}

This ability requires that the hag creator and the <i>hag eye</i> ooze be on the same plane in order to function. If the hag that created the <i>hag eye</i> ooze is part of a coven, the following spells have a 5% chance per caster level of operating through a <i>hag eye</i> ooze: <i>detect chaos</i>, <i>detect evil</i>, <i>detect good</i>, <i>detect law</i>, <i>detect magic</i>, <i>message</i>, <i>read magic</i>, and <i>tongues</i>. A non-hag that controls a <i>hag eye</i> ooze can't cast spells through the ooze, nor can it see through the creature, but it can target the <i>hag eye</i> ooze with a <i>clairaudience/clairvoyance</i> spell and view through it in that manner.  </p><p><strong>Suction (Ex)</strong> A <i>hag eye</i> ooze can create a powerful suction against any surface it climbs, allowing it to cling to inverted surfaces with ease. It can establish or release suction as a swift action, and as long as it is using suction, it moves at half speed. Because of the suction, a <i>hag eye</i> ooze gains a +10 bonus to its CMD to resist bull rush attacks, awesome blow attacks, and other attacks and effects that attempt to physically move it from its location.  </p><p><strong>Transparent (Ex)</strong> A <i>hag eye</i> ooze is difficult to discern from its surroundings in most environments. A successful DC 15 Perception check is required to notice a <i>hag eye</i> ooze. Any creature that fails to notice it and walks into it automatically suffers damage as if struck by the <i>hag eye</i> ooze's slam attack.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Some hags create <i>hag eye</i> oozes to serve as scouts and spies, favoring them over humanoid servants due to the ease of control. With their ability to blend in with their surroundings and climb nearly any surface, these creatures patrol the hag's lair and surrounding territory. Hag eye oozes seem to be imbued with a sliver of the cautious side of their creator's personality, watching intruders from a distance and avoiding combat unless directed to attack. Once given a command, these creatures pursue their goal mindlessly until a countermand is given.  Hag eye oozes have gelatinous, transparent bodies that can sometimes grow larger than 5 cubic feet, though most are smaller, taking up roughly half that space. To date, no specimens have been found weighing more than 500 pounds.  <br /><strong>Creating a Hag Eye Ooze</strong><br />  The process of creating a <i>hag eye</i> ooze is a strange blend of cooking in a cauldron and the magic rituals involved in sparking simulated life into a construct. For more information on <i>hag eye</i>s see <i>Pathfinder Campaign Setting</i>: <i>Classic Horrors Revisited</i>.  Creating a <i>hag eye</i> ooze requires 2 weeks. This time is reduced if the brewer is working cooperatively. For each additional member of a coven involved in the process, the creation time is lessened by 2 days, to a minimum creation period of 3 days. During this period, various nutrients and ingredients must be added to the cauldron in which the ooze is brewed. As the ingredients are added the hag must consult strange texts and foul recipes to assure proper creation. If she misses a step or poorly measures a reagent, the necessary arcane energies to create the <i>hag eye</i> ooze do not properly bind to the creature's nascent form. If successful, she then begins a 24-hour ritual, during which the cauldron holding the brewing ooze is bombarded with spells. This ritual and spellcasting culminates in the addition of a <i>hag eye</i>- preferably from the hag creator. If the ritual is successful, the <i>hag eye</i> ooze animates fully formed and able to serve as a minion. The <i>hag eye</i> ooze is under the control of the creator, but in cases where a coven takes part in creating the ooze, control goes to the hag that supplied the <i>hag eye</i>.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Reign_of_Winter.jpg","_id":"GGFY2vAZ5JY0bqum"}

Once every 1d4 rounds as a standard action, a kokogiak can expel a 60-foot cone of blistering arctic winds, dealing 8d6 points of cold damage to all creatures struck. A successful DC 23 Reflex save halves this damage. Any creature damaged by this attack must then succeed at a DC 23 Fortitude save or become fatigued (or exhausted if it was already fatigued). The save DCs are Constitution-based.  </p><p><strong>Forlorn Gaze (Su)</strong> As a standard action, a kokogiak can lock its black eyes on a target within 60 feet to fascinate the creature. A successful DC 20 Will save negates this effect. Creatures that fail the save are fascinated and they see the kokogiak as a lost loved one, trusted friend in danger, or ally in desperate need. Once a creature is fascinated, the kokogiak can compel the creature to move toward it. Once adjacent, the creature is flat-footed against the kokogiak's attacks, but the creature receives a new saving throw at the beginning of its turn to break the fascination. This is a mind-affecting effect and the save DC is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Ice Walker (Ex)</strong> A kokogiak takes no penalty to speed or on Acrobatics, Climb, or Stealth checks in snowy or icy terrain or weather conditions. It can walk across snow crusts or thin ice without breaking through. In addition, a kokogiak can choose to not leave tracks when moving in this type of terrain.  </p><p><strong>Penetrating Sight (Ex)</strong> A kokogiak's sight is not affected by its own <i>fog cloud</i> or <i>solid fog</i> spell-like abilities. In addition, a kokogiak does not take any penalties on Perception checks while its snowing.  </p><p><strong>Sound Imitation (Ex)</strong> A kokogiak can mimic any voice or sound it has heard by making a successful Bluff check against a listener's Sense Motive check.</p></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Reign_of_Winter.jpg","_id":"GeLjGgaItMesqDQt"}

in addition to the gear listed here, Baba Yaga has access to a wide variety of other magic items that she can use at the GM's discretion.</p></div><hr /><div><p><strong>SPECIAL ABILITIES</strong></p></div><hr /><div><p><strong>Contingency</strong> Whenever Baba Yaga is attacked, she is affected by <i>mislead</i>.  </p><p><strong>Exceptional Stats (Ex)</strong> Baba Yaga was born a perfect specimen of humanity. As a result, her ability scores were generated using 25 points, rather than using the standard 15 point buy used to create most NPCs. Additionally, Baba Yaga has much more gear than an NPC of her level would normally have. These modifications increase her total CR by 2.  </p><p><strong>Forceful Presence (Ex)</strong> Baba Yaga adds her Charisma modifier as an insight bonus to her Armor Class and on all of her saving throws. In addition, Baba Yaga uses her Charisma score as well as her Constitution score when calculating hit points. This ability increases her total CR by 1.  </p><p><strong>Hut Familiar (Ex)</strong> Baba Yaga built her <i>Dancing Hut</i> using a combination of the witch's hut hex and the sanctum mythic path ability, and over time expanded the artifact's powers to its present state. The <i><i>Dancing Hut</i> of Baba Yaga</i> serves as Baba Yaga's familiar, and replaces the normal witch's familiar ability. Baba Yaga's life is forever intertwined with her <i>Dancing Hut</i> and parts of her essence reside within it. As long as the hut exists, this special connection grants her 300 bonus hit points, DR 10/epic and good, and regeneration 20. This ability increases her total CR by 1.  </p><p><strong>Immortal (Su)</strong> Baba Yaga has hidden her death to make herself even more difficult to kill. This functions as the base mythic ability (<i>Mythic Adventures</i> 13), but Baba Yaga always returns to life 24 hours later, regardless of how she is killed. In order to permanently kill Baba Yaga, her death must be found and released back into her body, at which point she can be killed with a coup de grace or critical hit made with an artifact.  </p><p><strong>Long-Lived (Ex)</strong> Mystical arcane powers, mythic abilities, and complex arcane rituals have extended Baba Yaga's life. She gains the +3 bonus to Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores for having lived beyond venerable age, but she doesn't gain the penalties to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution resulting from this advanced age. Baba Yaga's supernaturally empowered life grants her complete immunity to ability damage and drain, charm and compulsion effects, death effects, disease, energy drain, petrification, poison, and all forms of madness (including <i>confusion</i> effects and <i>feeblemind</i>). This ability increases her total CR by 1.  </p><p><strong>Permanent Spells</strong> Through the use of <i>permanency</i>, Baba Yaga is constantly under the effect of the following spells: <i>arcane sight</i>, <i>darkvision</i>, <i>read magic</i>, <i>see invisibility</i>, and <i>tongues</i>. Baba Yaga has also devised a way to inscribe symbol spells upon her person. Baba Yaga has permanent <i>symbols of death</i> (DC 36) magically inscribed on the center of her chest, between her shoulder blades, upon the crown of her head, and on the soles of her feet. Only a few great beings have knowledge of the symbols' passwords (each symbol has its own unique phrase), and even fewer significant personalities have been attuned to the symbols.  </p><p><strong>Queen of Witches (Ex)</strong> As Queen of Witches, Baba Yaga knows all witch spells, as well as all sorcerer/wizard spells. Baba Yaga also has knowledge of many other spells that she has researched. Many of these are arcane versions of divine spells. In addition, Baba Yaga can create artifacts, and has done so to great extent, the greatest of which is the <i><i>Dancing Hut</i> of Baba Yaga</i>.</p></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Reign_of_Winter.jpg","_id":"H0Z0ItJw0vQA6tuA"}

In addition, certain spells function differently against the creature, as noted below.  • A <i>confusion</i> spell <i>slow</i>s it (as the <i>slow</i> spell) for 2d6 rounds, with no saving throw.  • A <i>mending</i> spell heals 2d6 hit points.\"  </p><p><strong>Linked Attack (Su)</strong> When a witch-doll golem successfully establishes a witch-doll link, any damage taken by the witch-doll golem from any source other than the linked target deals half its damage to the golem and half its damage to the linked target as long as the golem and the linked target are within 60 feet of each other. Only the linked target can successfully attack a witch-doll golem and not take \"linked damage.\" Attacks that don't damage a witch-doll golem (because of its immunities or its damage reduction) likewise deal no damage to the linked target. Attacks that damage the linked target do not damage the witch-doll golem (the link it establishes is one way). Healing (or repair in the case of the witch-doll golem) is not passed through the link.

The target must succeed at a DC 22 Fortitude save to resist the link. A witch-doll link is broken if the witch-doll golem is destroyed or the linked target dies. A witch-doll golem can only have one witch-doll link at any given time.

A dawn piper must be in possession of a musical instrument in order to use this ability. The save DC is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Elemental Font (Su)</strong> A dawn piper can infuse a 40-foot-radius area with the primal qualities of the First World. The creation of an elemental font requires a musical instrument and a musical ritual lasting 8 hours. As long as the piper returns to it every 24 hours, a font can persist forever, but it is destroyed immediately upon the creator's death. A dawn piper can also destroy its own font as a full-round action. The dawn piper gains additional spell-like abilities based on a single element while within range of its elemental font. <i>Dimensional anchor</i> and <i>dimensional lock</i> stop the flow of power, preventing the piper from using the additional spell-like abilities. The save DCs are Charisma-based, and the spell-like abilities are cast at caster level 7th.  <i>Air</i>: 2/day-<i>fly</i>, <i>gust of wind</i> (DC 15), <i>shocking grasp</i>  <i>Earth</i>: 2/day-<i>grease</i> (DC 14), <i>spiked</i> pit (DC 16), <i>stone</i> call  <i>Fire</i>: 2/day-<i>burning hands</i> (DC 14), <i>fireball</i> (DC 16), <i>pyrotechnics</i> (DC 15)  <i>Water</i>: 2/day-<i>aqueous</i> orb (DC 16), <i>hydraulic</i> push, slipstream  </p><p><strong>Terrible Beauty (Su)</strong> As a standard action, a dawn piper can surround itself in an intense aura of magnificence that is too potent for non-fey to withstand. Non-fey creatures within a 30-foot radius of the dawn piper must succeed at a DC 16 Will save or be blinded or deafened for 1d4 rounds (the piper's choice, but the effect is consistent for all affected creatures), and take 1 point of bleed damage from their eyes or ears (depending on the specific effect). This aura lasts 1 full round, and a creature that succeeds at its saving throw cannot be affected again for 24 hours. This is a visual or auditory, mind-affecting effect. A dawn piper requires a musical instrument in order to create this aura. The save DC for this ability is Charisma-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Strange and enigmatic creatures from the First World, dawn pipers are unmistakably humanoid and share some of the same delicate features of half-elves. But dawn pipers' otherworldly nature becomes evident when one looks at the creatures' eyes, which burn with a strange light. Their skin is smooth, free of blemish or body hair, and radiant. Their hair moves constantly, like the flickering flames of a torch in the breeze, and seems to express a seasonal theme in coloration. Their faces are portraits of every emotion that passes through their consciousness; joy, loss, and murder may all dance across their expressions in a matter of moments. Only when a dawn piper is asleep or plays a soothing melody on its pipes does its expression become static and human-and through such songs, dawn pipers' heartbreaking beauty becomes truly evident.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Early on in their primordial realm, dawn pipers toyed with emotion and its effects on the mutable nature of the First World. They marveled at how their plane could be transformed by an expression of strong will and passion. Their name allegedly stems from being the \"musicians at the dawn of Creation.\" Yet, coming from the First World, they are soulless creatures and immortal on their home plane. Dawn pipers cannot hold on to their feelings, and with the passage of time their emotions slip away from them like sand through their fingers. Through study and experimentation, dawn pipers devised a means to cheat their own ephemeral nature through music. The pipers associate emotion with melody, and when their passions leave them, they recreate them from memory through their music. While music is an exercise in creativity, it also has elements of structure and pattern, and that is what the pipers retain long after other fleeting experiences fade. This is no small advantage in the highly morphic environment of the First World, allowing them to knead and shape portions of their home through the use of music and emotion. Though the dawn pipers have no strict elemental association, they may also use their music to create an elemental font through which they can channel and shape the energies of the Inner Planes.  Dawn pipers are not wholly flesh and bone, as a raw creative power also infuses them-the source of the burning light that shines out of their eyes. Despite their transitory emotions, there is enough definition imposed upon their existence that they remain subject to physical laws. If killed in the First World, dawn pipers do not truly die but are reborn. The same cannot be said when they expire on other worlds.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Dawn pipers have no formal, overarching society of their own, but they sometimes form small partnerships called choirs, which always have a prime number of members. They act as entertainers, advisors, and shapers among the fey of the First World. Outsiders find them easy to dismiss as slaves to the very emotions they conjure, but nothing could be less true. Dawn pipers are usually shrewd and manipulative, and merely play at the role of a manic social gadf ly. It is said that azatas can sometimes reason with them when they meet; otherwise, dawn pipers jockey for power and inf luence with fey beings greater than themselves. Dawn pipers are great proponents of subsuming parts of the Material Plane into the First World, yet few such incursions ever happen because they are reluctant to travel to the Material Plane, where they are mortal, unless on a matter of great importance. They rarely take mortal lovers as such dalliances seldom end happily-though when they do partake in them, there are always new melodies waiting to be improvised by which to remember the forsaken relationships.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Dawn Piper Choirs</strong></p><p>  A choir of dawn pipers can use their elemental fonts to absorb a part of the Material Plane into the First World by creating a reality siphon. To open a reality siphon, at least three dawn pipers must perform a musical ritual lasting 8 hours. Each piper must have its own elemental font prior to the start of the ritual, and no font can be more than 400 feet from another. At the conclusion of the ritual, the reality siphon appears, creating a 10-foot-radius hemispherical area of twisted reality that functions as an <i>antilife shell</i> (CL 9th). After the ritual is complete, the pipers are free to take other actions until the reality siphon fully manifests. Over the course of 1 week, the reality siphon gradually expands until it encompasses a 400-foot-radius area, at which point everything in the area encompassed by the reality siphon is fully subsumed into the First World. Destroying the elemental fonts sustaining the reality siphon before it fully manifests causes it to implode upon itself, destroying the siphon and preventing it from drawing part of the Material Plane into the First World.  At the GM's discretion, certain more powerful choirs may have additional spell-like abilities, similar to the abilities a hag's coven possesses. They may also have powers related to the alteration of their environment in the First World.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Reign_of_Winter.jpg","_id":"Jd3f3x4zAn6Y8jWl"}

If the save fails, the target takes 1d6 additional points of fire damage, is sickened by pain for 1d4 rounds, and becomes permanently dazzled. If this results in the loss of all of the target's eyes, it is permanently blinded.  </p><p><strong>Inversion (Ex)</strong> As a move action, an azgenzak can invert its sac-like body, turning itself inside out and exposing its innumerable burning eyes. Doing so surrounds the azgenzak with a fiery aura and activates its frightful presence ability. These abilities are suppressed when the azgenzak is not inverted. When it's inverted, creatures adjacent to the azgenzak take 2d6 points of fire damage and risk catching on fire. A successful DC 16 Reflex save halves this damage and keeps the creature from catching on fire. An inverted azgenzak loses its racial bonus to Stealth underwater and takes a further -10 penalty on Stealth checks. In addition, when inverted, an azgenzak can't swallow its victim whole; however, if it begins its turn with a creature grappled, it can revert itself as a move action and then use its swallow whole ability. A creature swallowed by an azgenzak is subject to its fiery aura and frightful presence even when the azgenzak is not inverted.  </p><p><strong>Swarming Pyrocules (Su)</strong> As a full-round action, an azgenzak can disgorge a swarm of burning eyeballs. This swarm has the same statistics as a bat swarm (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</i> 30), except it lacks the wounding special ability, which is replaced by the azgenzak's burn ability and immunity to fire. An azgenzak using this ability takes 2d6 points of damage (though damage dealt to the swarming  pyrocules does not damage the azgenzak). The swarming pyrocules can't survive long separated from the azgenzak, and take 1 point of damage each round at the end of its turn. The swarming pyrocules can be reabsorbed by the azgenzak as a full-round action, healing the creature of 1d6 points of damage.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Azgenzaks, also called more prosaically \"sacks of burning eyes,\" are shapeless predators of unfathomable appetites and undeniable malevolence. They might have congealed into existence within some forgotten crack of the Outer Rifts, escaping (or being set loose) into the Material Plane ages ago. However, many theorize that these beings are entirely natural, primeval creatures that fell into savagery or never evolved from their primitive state in the first place. Azgenzaks are roughly 8 feet in diameter and weigh over 800 pounds.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Azgenzaks are amorphous, their bodies composed of a flaccid, leathery outer skin enveloping an interior of glistening, wrinkled tissue, which in turn surrounds hundreds of cilia-rimmed sockets that weep flammable mucus. An azgenzak can suppress its flames by squeezing its sac tightly closed, but it rarely does so unless it has need for stealth. If it wishes to maintain its flames even when it dives underwater, it simply enfolds a large bubble of air within its fundus, seals the aperture with a layer of mucus, and inf lates itself into a lumpy spheroid, periodically venting exhaust gases to propel itself through the water. A rush of foul-scented bubbles and brief flares of deep orange below the water's surface usually accompany such venting as jets of flame escape the azgenzak's interior and are snuffed out.  Azgenzaks are primarily carnivorous, though they're able to digest any organic material, engulfing it within their flaming cavities. An azgenzak that has recently feasted-having swallowed its prey whole-might sink to the bottom of a body of water and enfold itself to slowly digest its meal, settling into a torpor for days or even weeks at a time. If undisturbed, a hibernating azgenzak might appear indistinguishable from an algae-covered boulder, a rotting log, or submerged carrion.  Azgenzaks reproduce by asexual budding, which is abetted in some unknown way by the vitreous humors found within eyeballs. Its drive to extract the eyes of its prey is to further of its attempts at reproduction, as the distilled essence of the eyes it steals germinates tissue buds within the depths of its stomach. These buds then replicate and mat together into a translucent sheath of tissue, with a portion of the eyes within the azgenzak adsorbing into this sheath as it grows. Once a sufficient sheath-mass has accreted, it begins sloughing off from the parent azgenzak's stomach walls, and is eventually disgorged and discarded in a steaming puddle of semisolid translucent slime shot through with eyeballs. Now ravenously hungry, the parent moves on to feast elsewhere and replenish its discarded mass. Meanwhile, the newly birthed azgenzak begins to darken and congeal, baked from within by the unquenchable heat of its burning eyes, even as its outer tissues are tempered by exposure to open air and water, gradually toughening into a mottled brown outer skin. Gorging itself on organic matter, the newly formed azgenzak matures within a month and can begin to unleash the swarming pyrocules that are its deadly signature.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Azgenzaks are solitary creatures, despising the presence of others of their kind as rivals for their hunting terrain. They prefer to make their dens in murky lakes, though they are equally happy in swamps, bogs, and even slow-moving rivers. They are not powerful swimmers and avoid fast-moving water, though they are perfectly capable of climbing out of the water and traversing land in an undulant slither. Their malleable mass is able to ooze over, around, and between obstacles that might block the passage of a more solid creature.  Azgenzaks are sometimes confused with will-o'-wisps in folktales and legends, as both dwell in boglands and are blamed for mysterious marshlights that lead travelers to their doom. This is because azgenzaks are thought of more in terms of the swarming pyrocules they unleash rather than their true bodies-the strings of floating, flaming eyes are often believed to be the true creature and the \"bag\" of its body a gate to Hell, a fleshy opening into the Abyss, or a shroud stitched from the skins of its victims. In many cultures, strange bubbling and dancing marshlights below the water or bobbing above bogs are seen as portents of death even when seen in the far distance, regardless of the creature responsible. In lands where azgenzaks are known to dwell, animals are often blindered at night and children are taught to keep shutters and curtains drawn tight to avoid seeing the deadly lights.  In truth, azgenzaks are fairly simple creatures, mostly interested in their next meal. That said, they prefer the flesh of sentient victims and the screams of victims perishing in fear and fire. While they have no love for will-o'-wisps, they do sense a certain kinship with them, and more importantly they perceive the advantages of working with them to secure prey. Will-o'-wisps themselves offer no sustenance for an azgenzak, with their nearly immaterial bodies, but an azgenzak's ability to instill fear has much to offer hunting will-o'-wisps. The two creatures thus sometimes work in concert, with the azgenzak feasting physically upon its victims while the will-o'-wisp feeds psychically.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Reign_of_Winter.jpg","_id":"KKUYQUYf37BL7KXw"}

The erodaemon gains a +20 bonus on its Disguise and Bluff checks to impersonate that person and avoid being detected as a fraud, but spells like <i>true seeing</i> negate this effect as normal. This effect ends if the erodaemon attacks any creature. Actions that could reveal the erodaemon as a fraud (such as performing an action that the imitated person would obviously not do, like cast a spell or speak Infernal) require the erodaemon to attempt an immediate Bluff check to continue the impersonation, with the erodaemon losing some or all of its bonus depending on the severity of the breach (GM's discretion).  </p><p><strong>Wilting Kiss (Su)</strong> An erodaemon can draw a mortal into a state of obsession with its kiss.

Each round the target is more than <i>3</i>0 feet away from the erodaemon, it must attempt an additional DC 25 Will save. Failing the save means that the sheer pain of her absence deals 1 point of Charisma drain to the subject that round.

An opponent thrown into the furnace golem's interior is trapped as a metal grating closes over the opening in the same round. A trapped creature automatically takes 2d6 points of fire damage each round. Escaping the creature's interior requires a successful DC 30 Strength check to bend the bars. Alternatively, a trapped creature can escape by dealing at least 25 points of damage to the bars (AC 22; the golem's damage reduction applies to attacks against the bars as well). A Huge furnace golem's interior can hold two Medium, eight Small, or 16 Tiny or smaller creatures.  </p><p><strong>Immunity to Magic (Ex)</strong> A furnace golem is immune to spells or spell-like abilities that allow spell resistance. Certain spells and effects function differently against it, as noted below. <br /> • A magical attack that bypasses a furnace golem's cold resistance <i>slow</i>s it (as the <i>slow</i> spell) for 3 rounds, with no saving throw.  <br />• A magical attack that deals fire damage breaks any <i>slow</i> effect on the golem and heals 1 point of damage for each 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the golem to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points.</p></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Reign_of_Winter.jpg","_id":"RZZCoUxZDgP6BCH4"}

If the attack is successful, the target's soul is ripped from its body, which collapses in a heap on the ground. Although the victim is not dead, the target's soul appears as a ghostly copy of the victim superimposed over the body of the dead soldier crucified on the door, held in place by translucent spikes or nails. The victim cries out silently in pain, and is visible to all those viewing it.  A crucified soul cannot be attacked or affected by anything, cannot take any actions (other than trying to escape; see below), and experiences excruciating pain that deals 2 negative levels to it in the round it is crucified, and 1 negative level each round thereafter. A successful DC 25 Fortitude save is required to remove a negative level. A crucifixion spirit does not need to concentrate on this ability for it to continue to affect a target, and the crucifixion spirit can direct attacks against different opponents. A creature whose soul is crucified can try to escape each round by attempting a DC 25 Will save. If the save is successful, the creature's soul is freed from its torment and returns to its body in the same round. The creature is stunned for 1 round, but can act normally afterward.

It is said that this wintery power freezes the heart of any normally good fey, corrupting the creature's nature and infusing it with hatred and spite. While a winter fey is visually recognizable as being a variant of its normal counterpart, its personality is decidedly altered. Whereas most fey are merely capricious and whimsical, winter fey take pleasure in causing pain and suffering. A winter fey is the same size as its normal counterparts, but it typically weighs a bit more because of the ice crusting its body.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Found mainly in the reaches of the far north and the frigid regions of the First World, winter fey live in places far too cold for most humanoids to survive without magical assistance. The harsh landscape and bone-chilling climate match the hearts of these bitter creatures. A winter fey found far from cold lands is typically acting on the orders of a liege or in pursuit of an especially wily victim, as few choose to wander so close to the \"hot lands\" without a particular purpose in mind. However, winter fey have been known to travel deep into warmer climates in order to play a worthy enough trick on a creature.  Some winter fey are known to move south every winter in search of new creatures to steal from, torment, or maim. As cruel as a winter storm, a winter fey feels no remorse for those it hurts. For its own amusement, a winter fey leads its victims far from civilization without any means to protect themselves from the elements and then abandon them, typically leaving them to freeze to death. Such a fey creature targets the innocent and gullible simply for sinister laughs, spending months crafting an exceptional ruse and then watching it play out. Savoring such delicious cruelty is what winter fey live for.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  On Golarion, winter fey live in the cold northern realms, staying far away from the heat of summer. When winter strikes, these malevolent creatures sometimes migrate south with the snowstorms, then return to the north as quickly as they came, at the first sign of the spring thaw.  Being able to craft an original and depraved trick upon a creature and share the tale of that trick is how a winter fey gains respect and ultimately a greater status among its peers. Once a winter fey plays a trick upon a creature, that creature is considered marked. Although it is not forbidden to trick a creature marked by another winter fey, young winter fey caught doing so are looked on as sloppy and unoriginal. As such, young winter fey are constantly looking for new creatures upon whom to let their wicked imaginations run wild, while their elders poach their marked targets. Sometimes winter fey work together to pull off a truly heinous yet epic trick. One of the best-known times that a group of winter fey worked together like this involved a bloody carnival of torture and death.  A winter fey's characteristic icy claws are frequently stained with blood. Winter fey love nothing more than to feel the suffering they cause with their own frosty hands. Blood and gore from warm-bodied creatures are among the few sources of warmth winter fey willingly touch, and they often display a prize of their most recent murderous delight-usually a body part of one of their victims-until a new target is marked for death.  <strong><br />Creating a Winter Fey</strong><br />  \"Winter fey\" is an inherited template that can be added to any fey creature without the fire subtype, referred to hereafter as the base creature. A winter fey uses all the base creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted here.  <br /><strong>CR:</strong> As base creature +1.  <br /><strong>Alignment:</strong> Any evil.  Type: The base creature's type remains fey, but it gains the cold subtype.  <br /><strong>AC:</strong> Natural armor improves by +2.  <br /><strong>Defensive Abilities:</strong> A winter fey retains the base creature's defensive abilities, and gains the following ability.  <br /><i>Fast Healing (Su)</i>: A winter fey gains fast healing 3 when in contact with ice or snow.  <br /><strong>Speed:</strong> A winter fey retains the base creature's normal movement and gains the following.  <br /><i>Ice Walking (Ex)</i>: A winter fey takes no penalty to speed or on Acrobatics, Climb, or Stealth checks in snowy or icy terrain or weather conditions and can walk across snow crusts or thin ice without breaking through.  <br /><strong>Attacks:</strong> A winter fey retains all the natural weapons, manufactured weapon attacks, and weapon proficiencies of the base creature. A creature with hands gains one claw attack per hand; the winter fey can strike with each of its claw attacks at its full attack bonus. A claw attack deals damage as if the winter fey <i>RPG Bestiary</i> 301-302). If the base creature already had claw attacks with its hands, use the winter fey claw damage only if it's better.  <br /><strong>Special Attacks:</strong> A winter fey retains the base creature's special attacks and gains the ones listed below.  <br /><i>Frigid Touch (Su)</i>: Once per day, a winter fey may attempt a touch attack against a foe; if successful, it deals 1d6 points of Dexterity damage by freezing the blood in its victim's veins and numbing its victim to the bone.  <br /><i>Frosty Grasp (Su)</i>: A winter fey's natural attacks, as well as any weapons it wields, deal an additional 1d6 points of cold damage.  <br /><strong>Abilities:</strong> A winter fey's Strength and Constitution increase by +2.  <br /><strong>Skills:</strong> A winter fey gains a +4 racial bonus on Survival checks when in cold environments.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Reign_of_Winter.jpg","_id":"SpFr8IBGj6jlbMkY"}

It treats these weapons as natural attacks and not manufactured weapons. It cannot make iterative attacks with these weapons. An animated tank has its weapons arranged on all sides of its body and can make three machine gun attacks and one Hotchkiss 6 pounder attack each round. An animated tank's weapons can still be targeted by effects that target manufactured weapons (such as <i>magic weapon</i> spells or sunder attempts), but cannot easily be harvested for use once the animated tank is destroyed. An animated tank is always proficient with its weapons, and its ranged weapons do not provoke attacks of opportunity when fired in melee combat.  </p><p><strong>Telekinesis (Su)</strong> The pickled brain that animates the tank possesses a supernatural ability to manipulate its surroundings and reload its armament.

Preserved in glass vessels, bathed in nutrient fluids, and wired to strange energies and bizarre technologies, these organs are given new life, as their mental talents are preserved and tapped to independently control monstrous war machines. Though the methods, magic, and technology used differ between creators of these hulking engines, incarnations of these creatures typically take the form of captured siege engines and vehicles retrofitted to allow independent control by the pickled brains inside.  Animated tanks are perhaps the most dangerous of such animate siege engines. Thought haunted by some, and simply assumed by others to be well-commanded vehicles crewed by crack soldiers, these animated monstrosities are feared and loathed on battlefields across the front. Blessed with incredible armor and the ability to never tire or deplete their stocks of ammunition, these creatures run roughshod over trenches and barricades alike, grinding troops unfortunate enough to fall beneath their tracks to splinters of meat and bone. The tremendous range afforded by their armaments only makes matters worse for those forced to confront the lumbering monstrosities, and finding a weakness within their steel carcasses is nigh impossible.  Animated tanks are found in the company of one or more rifle or flamethrower troops; these soldiers are usually either keenly aware of the tank's unique magical animation, or wholly ignorant of its mysterious and taciturn movements as they simply follow their commander's orders without regard to the tank's missing crew. Those hearing the tanks' orders in their own heads, however, instantly realize that something is not quite normal. As animated tanks are built with the armored frames of British Mark IV tanks-a common war wagon on First World War battlefields-few soldiers question the orders of their superiors when tasked with accompanying one of the beasts. Though Mark IV tanks could normally hold a crew of eight, the cabin of an animated tank is filled with strange technological and alchemical devices, allowing only four Medium creatures space to ride inside-that is, if the animated tank agrees to carry passengers.  Animated tanks were designed by Viktor Miloslav for use by the Russian Imperial Army, and it is thought that this mad experimentation and blasphemous use of the deceased is what triggered his exile to the cold wastes of Siberia and his imprisonment in the Akuvskaya prison camp. It is ultimately unknown how effective the creations of Viktor Miloslav proved on the battlefields of the Great War, or whether any of the monstrosities survived the war, as their shelled-out carcasses look little different from normal tanks, with the exception of a faint smell of formaldehyde and remnants of broken glass not usually found with tanks of this model. Whether some slumbering beast waits patiently in some forgotten barn or warehouse remains to be seen, or whether brave soldiers have laid this dangerous and blasphemous technology to rest is unknown, but hopefully Viktor Miloslav's mad designs have all been destroyed or lost forever.  <strong><strong></strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>Variants</strong></strong></p><p>  Viktor Miloslav is rumored to have created variations on the normal Mark V tank during his brief explorations into self-animated war machines during World War I.  \"Female\" Animated Tank (CR 11): So named because it lacked the heavier Hotchkiss 6 pounder guns of its more robust counterpart, this variant makes up for its lack of explosive firepower with a bristling barrage of machine gun fire, being able to make up to five attacks per round with its Maxim M1910 machine guns. The tanks are otherwise identical in most respects, and few find a female animated tank's lack of Hotchkiss 6 pounder guns a relief when faced with its withering machine gun attacks.  The \"Moving Fortress\" (CR 13): Once word of Viktor Miloslav's inventions spread to Germany, the engineers there tried to replicate the effects he'd achieved, though it's unknown to what degree they succeeded. Should one of these specimens have survived, it would have been much more highly armored, built on the base of the German A7V tank-designed literally like a tracked, armored land ship. A moving fortress has 2 additional Hit Dice, and its natural armor bonus is increased by 5. Its single main gun, more robust than the Hotchkiss 6 pounder, deals an additional 4d6 points of damage, and the moving fortress is equipped with six Maxim M1910 machine guns.  <br /><strong>Construction</strong><br />  An animated tank is built by retrofitting a preexisting tank and hard-wiring its pickled brain to the controls through strange technology, rather than crafting the construct's tank body from scratch. The secrets to preserving brains and connecting them to metal war wagons is lost, as is the nonmagical technological process by which Viktor Miloslav constructed the monstrosities found on Earth during the First World War. However, those able to inspect a destroyed specimen may be able to reconstruct the process. In addition to an animated tank's creation requirements-beyond the body of an intact tank-an animating brain must be harvested soon after its body is deceased, preserved with <i>gentle repose</i>, and subjected to a special nutrient bath before being revived and ultimately hooked into the tank. Only time and experimentation will reveal whether other secrets to this mysterious process were lost in the chaos of war on Earth.  <br /><strong>ANIMATED TANK</strong><br />  <br /><strong>CL</strong> 12th; <strong>Price</strong> 200,000 gp  </p><p><strong>CONSTRUCTION </strong> </p><p><strong>Requirements </strong>Craft Construct, <i>animate object</i>, <i>geas/quest</i>, <i>resurrection</i>, <i>telekinesis</i>; <strong>Skill</strong> Craft (blacksmithing), Knowledge (engineering), and Heal DC 25; <strong>Cost</strong> 100,000</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Reign_of_Winter.jpg","_id":"UIM4ZKCH3KsL2gVE"}

Some claim wollipeds weren't domesticated initially to be working animals, but rather were herded and bred for their extremely warm and plentiful fleece. In any case, Triaxians have a long history of using these magnificent animals for many purposes, even employing them as mounts in battle. A typical wolliped stands between 5 and 6 feet at the front shoulder and weighs upward of 1,000 pounds.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Wollipeds are social herd animals that subsist on a diet of grasses, leaves, and other plant material. Wollipeds in high mountainous environments obtain much of their food from lichens and mosses, while herds of wollipeds on the plains graze on more substantial fare. Wild wollipeds tend to migrate to more plentiful foraging lands when winter comes to Triaxus, though these can be difficult to find. Domesticated wollipeds, tended to by their Triaxian herders, are found throughout nearly all of Triaxus.  Walking on eight sturdy legs, wollipeds are exceptionally sure-footed. These creatures can climb steep mountain trails and march through heavy snow with little effort, and Triaxian cavalry have often charged up scree-choked hillsides to raid fortresses on the backs of armored wollipeds. The great beasts' facility at maneuvering in challenging environments and generally submissive nature have resulted in a long relationship with the humanoids on Triaxus. Wollipeds live for about 15 years, mating and giving birth every 11 months, and can be ridden until the final month of pregnancy.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Wollipeds are social animals, grouping together into herds for protection. When threatened, wollipeds gather in a tight cluster with the young animals kept in the very center of the herd. Domesticated wollipeds are used for casual riding, pulling plows, and walking circles to power wollimills.  While other exotic fabrics are available during a Triaxian summer, the mainstay of Triaxian winter textiles is spun wolliped fleece. Wolliped fibers wick water away, and still provide adequate warmth even when soaked, while the variations in coat colors and textures provide a wide array of design options.  Like Triaxians, wollipeds exhibit distinct seasonal variance. Wollipeds born during the winter have long, thick, shaggy coats of fine fibers with a hollow core, while those born in the summers have shorter, thinner coats. Rather than the coats of individuals changing, the change happens generationally; winter wollipeds give birth to short-coated summer wollipeds as the planet warms, and vice versa. The process happens quickly, usually beginning in eastern Aylok, though no one knows precisely why.  In addition to wolliped fleece, some Triaxian artisans use the ivory from wolliped tusks as a raw material, but this is most common for wollipeds born during the winter, as their tusks are three times the size of those born in summer. Winterborn wollipeds use their foot-long tusks for a variety of purposes. In addition to using them to dig in the ice and snow for deep green tubers, burmoss, and patches of sentient tulbos fungus that stretches beneath the ice, wollipeds clash their tusks together in competitions for dominance within a herd and as part of their mating displays.  Wollipeds use spitting as a form of communication as well as for defense. Most wollipeds only spit at one another, typically in the course of their tusk-clashing shows of dominance, but when threatened they can launch a nauseating wad of partially digested fodder at their attackers. Some trained wolliped mounts have honed this nature into a weapon guided by their riders.  The dragons of Triaxus have little use for terrestrial mounts, and instead use wollipeds as a consistent source of food. More than half of all domesticated wollipeds eventually feed Triaxus's dragon population, though most wollipeds used for meat are older animals whose fleece has turned coarse and brittle. Triaxians also eat wolliped flesh, but most consider young and healthy animals too valuable to eat except during desperate winter years.  Regional Variants The statistics on the facing page represent the most common breed of wolliped native to the Drakelands, the Allied Territories, and the Skyfire Mandate. In addition to these, a multitude of other breeds exist throughout Triaxus.  Alurals: Triaxians of the Unbound Tribes breed the best wollipeds for battle, with their steeds recognized worldwide as being the strongest and most aggressive. Alurals are also the only known breed of wolliped that is carnivorous. Tribes here collect wolliped milk, fermenting it into a potent alcoholic beverage used for rituals, feasts, and holy days. Alurals have the advanced simple template.  Ningese Wollipeds: The remote nation of Ning breeds the smallest wollipeds on Triaxus. Ningese wollipeds are quick and nimble, using these traits to elude the hordes of monsters threatening the civilized regions of the nation. Wollipeds here are primarily used for fleece and food. In the summer, Ningese wollipeds grow to Medium size and their speed increases by 10 feet. Ningese wollipeds born in the harsh winter are Small and have 2 fewer Hit Dice; their Strength and Constitution decreases by 2, and their Dexterity increases by 2.  <br /><strong>Wolliped Companions</strong><br /> <strong>Starting Statistics: Size</strong> Medium; <strong>Speed</strong> 50 ft.; <strong>AC</strong> +1 natural armor, <strong>Attack</strong> gore (1d6); <strong>Ability Scores</strong> Str 14, Dex 16, Con 12, Int 2, Wis 11, Cha 4; <strong>Special Qualities</strong> low-light vision, scent.  <strong>7th-Level Adv.: Size</strong> Large; <strong>AC</strong> +3 natural armor; <strong>Attack</strong> gore (1d8); <strong>Ability Scores</strong> Str +4, Dex -2, Con +4; <strong>Special Abilities</strong> spit, trample.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Reign_of_Winter.jpg","_id":"XAEELky62cvVYrO1"}

Transitional Triaxians do not have this ability.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Triaxians are the dominant race on the planet Triaxus, a world whose erratic orbit causes exceptionally long and disparate seasons. Though eerily similar to humans, elves, and the other mammalian humanoids common on Golarion, Triaxians have developed certain adaptations to their environment that mark them as indisputably alien.  Just like human ethnicities, Triaxian populations vary in size, weight, and other distinguishing physical characteristics, based primarily on the geographical regions in which they reside. Most Triaxians, both males and females, are around 6 feet tall but somewhat lean compared to humans, rarely weighing more than 200 pounds. Their ears are elongated, but rather than being pointed like elves or half lings, these appendages are instead notched in a feathered or comblike pattern. The flaps created by these notches constantly move to adjust the ear's shape, operating both consciously and unconsciously to help Triaxians focus on specific sounds, not unlike the maneuverable ears of dogs, cats, and other such animals.  Like many creatures on their world, Triaxians have evolved to shift along with their environment, resulting in differences between generations of the same family that would seem bizarre to humanoids from Golarion. In the warm summer years, Triaxians are completely hairless, with skin that ranges from deep red to coffee-colored to charcoal black. This configuration allows them to better survive in the sweltering heat of the planet's tropical summers, with the increased melanin in their dark skin protecting them from the sun's intense rays. These Summerborn Triaxians, as they are known, breed true for many generations-yet as the planet begins its rapid seasonal shift, so do the Triaxians. Newborn Triaxians begin to evince new adaptations to the cooling environment, and by the time winter has come on in full, Triaxians change markedly: their pale bodies are covered in fine, insulating white fur like that of an ermine, while their eyes narrow to elongated slits to protect against snowblindness. These new traits similarly breed true until the seasons begin to change once more, at which point the eyes widen and fur recedes, starting the cycle anew.  Just as Triaxians differ physically depending on which season they're born into, so do their cultures and customs change. Winterborn Triaxians are defined by the hardship of a world whose very environment seeks to starve or freeze them. They tend to be stolid, hardworking people, with an ironclad sense of honor stemming from the knowledge that in a Triaxian winter, a broken promise can mean death for a whole clan. Even within large communities, the focus remains on survival for one's family and friends, with individuals willing and ready to share, serve, and die to protect the group. Oaths of friendship are serious affairs; once given they are rarely transgressed, and doing so risks a blood feud. With the exception of those nomadic hunter tribes that migrate in pursuit of herd animals, most settlements are permanent and fortified against the predatory horrors that stalk the blinding blizzards.  Summerborn Triaxians, by contrast, are born into a world of plenty. With forests full of fruit and game, and glaciers receding to reveal vast tracts of fertile earth, the attachment to cold stone fortresses and cramped cities weakens, and Triaxians spread out across the landscape. For many, it is a time of nomadism, living in small bands and temporary structures, or else participating in great waves of land-grabs as homesteaders. Though they still have the weight of history to remind them of the hardships of their ancestors-and those yet to come for their descendants- Summerborn Triaxians tend to be an easy-going, generous people, quick to accept outsiders, to break with their clans and families and strike out on their own, and to challenge convention in pursuit of greater goals. They are simultaneously less hardened and more likely to go to war, for with the business of survival taking less energy and new territory constantly being settled, leaders have more time and resources to dispute borders and jockey for power. Historically, Summerborn Triaxians are those most likely to visit other planes or worlds, as the drive to explore their newly thawed planet also leads them to look beyond it.  Transitional Triaxians occupy a much smaller portion of the Triaxian adaptation cycle than either the Summerborn or Winterborn-usually no more than a generation each orbital year-and often play an uncomfortable role in their society. To Summerborn Triaxians, a Transitional child is an ill omen-a sign that winter approaches, and that the time of plenty is drawing to a close. The first such individuals to appear are often hidden or slain by their parents, and vilified by those rebellious fools and leaders who believe that Transitional children actively bring on the winter, or who simply don't want to begin the long and arduous process of preparing for future generations' survival. Transitional children born at the tail of winter, on the other hand, are often treasured and held up as hopeful signs of a golden era to come. Yet even these may face persecution by those dynasties that fear change, or whose leaders expect a loss of power once their people are free to spread beyond their reach. In both cases, Transitional Triaxians find themselves in a society where they are visibly different from both their parents and their children, and where their very existence is a weighty portent.  Strangely, while Triaxians' mutable nature is perfectly adapted to their planet's erratic orbit, the cycle of physiological changes seems keyed to internal clocks rather than external indicators. Even in situations where these adaptations would be disadvantageous, the small populations of Triaxians who have set up residence on other worlds or planes continue to change in time with their kindred on Triaxus.  Beyond their obvious adaptations to their environment, Triaxians are remarkably human. Their basic biology, social structures, cultures, and philosophy-while sometimes surprising to outsiders-all fall well within the bounds of what might be encountered in a humanoid race on Golarion, thus making them one of the least \"alien\" civilizations in Golarion's solar system. Though the statistics above represent a typical initiate training to become a Dragonrider of the Skyfire Mandate, this is by no means the standard for the race-outside of broad strokes, it's as impossible to describe Triaxians' myriad traits and predispositions as it would be to do so for humanity itself. Triaxians are good and evil, warlike and peaceful, magical and mundane, and everything in between.  For more information on Triaxians and Triaxus, see <i>Pathfinder Campaign Setting</i>: <i>Distant Worlds</i> and \"Planet of Dragons\" on page 64.  <br /><strong>Triaxian CHARACTERS (10 RP)</strong><br />  Triaxians don't possess racial Hit Dice, gaining their capabilities instead from class levels. All Triaxians have the following racial traits.  <br /><strong>+2 Constitution, +2 Wisdom, -2 Strength:</strong> Triaxians are a hardy and wily race, as befits their constantly changing environment, but their lean forms have trouble maintaining large amounts of muscle mass.  <br /><strong>Low-Light Vision:</strong> In dim light, Triaxians can see twice as far as humans.  <br /><strong>Keen Senses:</strong> Triaxians' unique ear construction grants them a +2 bonus on Perception checks.  <br /><strong>Bonus Feat:</strong> Triaxians select one extra feat at 1st level.  <br /><strong>Seasoned:</strong> See above.  <br /><strong>Languages:</strong> Triaxians speak Triaxian (the common trade language of Triaxus). Triaxians with high Intelligence scores can choose any languages they want (except secret languages, such as Druidic).</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Reign_of_Winter.jpg","_id":"Zk0eBG6FURpHca9S"}

This effect is similar to the <i>sending</i> spell, but it takes only a standard action, the communication is one way, and the target cannot respond to the <i>sending</i>.  </p><p><strong>Mirror Sight (Ex)</strong> A mirror man has no eyes, but is capable of visually perceiving through the use of blindsight, darkvision, and low-light vision.  </p><p><strong>Scrying Focus (Su)</strong> Mirror men are specifically created to interact with the spell <i>Irriseni mirror sight</i> (Pathfinder <i>Adventure Path</i> #67 73) in special ways. The construct's mirrored face can serve as a known mirror, allowing the caster to see from the perspective of the construct's face with normal sight. The caster may also communicate telepathically with the mirror man. As a swift action, the mirror man can choose to remember and record up to 1 minute of what it sees. This memory is visual only and can be viewed remotely through <i>Irriseni mirror sight</i> or played back across its face. The mirror man can only retain 1 minute of images; when its memory is full, old memories are erased so it can remember new ones. The caster may interact with the mirror man's soul mirror even after the construct body is destroyed as long as the face itself remains unbroken. If the construct has not been destroyed, an opponent must succeed at a sunder attempt targeting the mirrored face to break the mirror. The mirrored face is considered a separate weapon with a hardness of 1 and hit points equal to the mirror man's Hit Dice. If the construct has been destroyed, the mirrored face can be smashed as a standard action.  </p><p><strong>Soul Mirror (Su)</strong> The soul of a mirror man is bound within its mirrored face. As long as the face remains intact, it can be affixed to a new construct body using the same cost to create a new construct. Once a soul is bound to a mirror, the soul continues to learn, and if the mirror is later affixed to a new body, the soul retains any memories from its previous bodies.  </p><p><strong>Susceptible to Mind-Affecting Effects (Ex)</strong> The self-aware and autonomous nature of a mirror man makes it susceptible to mind-affecting effects, despite the fact that it is a construct.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>At a glance, mirror men are easily mistaken for humans. They are tall, slender, and graceful and mask their true selves in fine hooded cloaks appropriate to Irrisen's eternal winter. Nevertheless, their grace is the product of precision, not elegance, and their hooded garments serve to obscure an inhuman countenance. A mirror man has no eyes, nose, or mouth. Its face is a featureless mirror, affixed atop a lifeless body. Behind this mirror is a vacant hole left behind when the body was prepared for its current use.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Mirror men are constructs whose origin is less than a century old, and are typically found in larger Irriseni cities such as Whitethrone and Algidheart. Just as guardian dolls are animated with the souls of children, mirror men get their spark from adults-usually criminals. They are created to be the spies and assassins of the White Witches, and their construct nature makes them utterly loyal to the Jadwiga. Mirror men are cunning, merciless, and determined in the execution of their orders. Underneath their garments they resemble zombies, or even flesh golems. All unnecessary internal organs and fluids have been removed, and what remains is wrapped in cold muscle and skin of a grayish hue that is magically maintained and self-repairing. No eyes remain within their skulls, but the soul trapped within the mirror can sense all movement nearby.  While some golems and constructs are simple replacements for guards and protectors, the mirror men of Irrisen represent a very specific design. They are intended to investigate, spy, and report, and are created with abilities carefully selected to help them fulfill these purposes. Even their ability to magically create <i>light</i> serves to allow the witches to see better while peering through their looking-glass faces. Mirror men are trained to be familiar with nobility of the region, to detect forgeries, and to investigate crimes. There remains a flaw in their creation, however- any caster of <i>Irriseni mirror sight</i> can peer through the face of any mirror man she's familiar with. The White Witches of Irrisen often assume foreigners don't know their secrets, but nothing save tradition prevents an outlander from learning the spell. A mirror man can't attempt to resist an unwanted connection, and its only recourse when used as an ambulatory sensor for someone unauthorized is to cover its face and send a warning to the witch who governs it.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  For centuries, the Iron Guard observed and recorded events in Whitethrone; its members nominally served the Jadwiga but their true allegiance was to Baba Yaga-a fact that did not go unnoticed by the descendants of the 14 queens. Under Elvanna's reign, the mirror men were created to act as the eyes and ears, not of the Iron Guard, but of the White Witches themselves. For decades, the Jadwiga Elvanna maintained that the role of the mirror men was to provide additional oversight of the kingdom, but with the recent usurpation of Baba Yaga, the mirror men's role as the White Witches' secret police has become evident. Mirror men have broad authority to question, search, and arrest anyone but the Jadwiga themselves. Even with telepathy, mirror men avoid self-expression as much as possible whenever a gesture or pointed finger will suffice. In Whitethrone, it is universally understood when a mirror man jabs a finger at someone, followed by a tap on the open palm of their other hand, it means the citizen should stand still and allow himself to be viewed through the unsettling visage of the mirror man.  There is no love lost between the mirror men and any of Irrisen's monstrous citizens (or the Iron Guard, for that matter). The constructs' presence only fuels an atmosphere of paranoia and distrust as the monsters are left wondering who might be watching them as well as the native Ulfen slaves.  <br /><strong>Construction</strong><br />  The creation of a mirror man requires a single living creature (usually human), which is killed during the process. Its manufacture requires costly alchemical reagents and a mirror faceplate crafted specifically for the creature. The creature's soul is bound to the mirror, which prevents it from continuing to the afterlife and protects it from being resurrected or raised from the dead. Most of the original creature's memories are expunged, but mirror men retain many of their originals skills; consequently, the most effective mirror men are former career criminals and foreign spies. The creation process is excruciating to the victim, and creating a mirror man constitutes an evil act.  </p><p><strong>Mirror Man </strong> <br /><strong>CL</strong> 11th; <strong>Price</strong> 24,500 gp  </p><p><strong>CONSTRUCTION </strong> </p><p><strong>Requirements </strong>Craft Construct, <i>animate dead</i>, <i>cat's grace</i>, <i>geas/quest</i>, <i>Irriseni mirror sight</i>, <i>magic jar</i>, <i>sending</i>, creator must be caster level 11th, soul of a living creature that dies or is slain during the creation process; <strong>Skill</strong> Craft (sculpture) DC 17 or Heal DC 17; <strong>Cost</strong> 12,500 gp</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Reign_of_Winter.jpg","_id":"bAWy2LeCJbmF6Whj"}

This attack instead harms the infested creature-the mold effectively slithers out of the way of the incoming attack so that the blow strikes the creature it controls. The mindslaver mold must choose to attempt avoidance after the attack roll is resolved but before damage is rolled.  </p><p><strong>Infestation (Su)</strong> A mindslaver mold can climb onto and attach itself to a willing or helpless host as a standard action. As long as the mold infests its host, the mold shares the same 5-foot square with its host's space; this does not negatively impact the host or the mold. As long as a mindslaver mold infests a host, the host takes a -4 penalty on all Will saves made against the mindslaver mold's <i>dominate person</i> spell-like ability, and the duration of that spell-like ability on the host becomes permanent as long as the mold remains attached. Each day, an attached mindslaver mold deals 1d4 points of damage to its host as it feeds on the host's blood and other bodily fluids. A mindslaver mold can be torn free from its host with a successful DC 15 Strength check made as a standard action-doing so deals 2d6 points of damage as the mold's tendrils tear free. A dead mindslaver mold deals no damage when it is so removed.  </p><p><strong>Mold Mindlink (Su)</strong> A mindslaver mold can communicate telepathically with any other mindslaver mold within 10 miles, and knows the condition of all other mindslaver molds in this area as if it had a <i>status</i> spell in effect on all other molds.  </p><p><strong>Spore Pod (Ex)</strong> A mindslaver mold's sole physical attack is to launch a spore pod the size of a sling bullet. This is a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 20 feet.  </p><p><strong>Spores (Su)</strong> Whenever a mindslaver mold hits a creature with its spore pod, or whenever a creature touches a mindslaver mold (including when a creature hits the mold with a touch attack, unarmed strike, or natural attack), the creature must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save to avoid taking 1d4 points of Wisdom damage as the mold's spores swiftly drain away the victim's willpower and sense of self. The save DC is Constitution-based.</p></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Reign_of_Winter.jpg","_id":"dz64CxudeFHMrjhN"}

Retaining many of the memories and skills it possessed in life, a trench zombie contributes its intelligence into a sort of hive mind for the trench mist that originally spawned it, creating a true symbiosis between the two-a gift the trench zombie repays upon its destruction, when the horrific fumes that granted it unlife go back to the trench mist that birthed it. Trench zombies are foul and vengeful, and are canny enough to lurk within the nurturing embrace of their mother mist, which provides them concealment without impairing their senses. Those seeking trench zombies' destruction typically must enter the engulfing body of a trench mist if they are to ward off the zombies' ranged attacks. Trench zombies are created using the juju zombie template (<i>Bestiary 2</i> 291), but they lose the juju zombie's immunity to <i>magic missile</i>, which is replaced by immunity to acid. Trench zombies also gain the following special ability Symbiote (Ex).</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Reign_of_Winter.jpg","_id":"eOf4GrSHkoWVqkdM"}

She also becomes staggered and cannot use any of her spell-like abilities.  </p><p><strong>Grace (Su)</strong> A poludnica adds her Charisma modifier as a deflection bonus to her Armor Class.  </p><p><strong>Searing Weapons (Su)</strong> Any weapon a poludnica wields becomes incredibly hot and conducts and amplifies her ability to cause fatigue by reducing the target's ability to resist the effects.  In melee combat, such a weapon deals an additional 1d6 points of fire damage plus 1d2 points of Constitution damage. The Constitution damage is negated with a successful DC 21 Fortitude save. The weapon cools rapidly if it leaves her grasp, losing these additional abilities immediately.  </p><p><strong>Sunstroke Haze (Su)</strong> A poludnica radiates oppressive heat in a 10-foot radius. Any creature that starts its turn within this area must succeed at a DC 21 Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage and become fatigued. A fatigued creature that fails a second saving throw becomes exhausted. The fatigued or exhausted condition lasts for as long as the nonlethal damage goes unhealed. A poludnica can activate or suppress this ability as a free action and the save DC is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Tied to Day (Su)</strong> A poludnica's connection to the sun tethers her to the Material Plane. During <i>daylight</i> hours (from dawn to sunset), her abilities are as shown above whether she can actually see the sun or not. During the nighttime hours (from sunset to dawn), a poludnica shifts to the Ethereal Plane (as <i>ethereal</i> jaunt). This is automatic, involuntary, and causes a poludnica great distress. While on the Ethereal Plane, a poludnica is affected by her darkness powerlessness and is nearly helpless. This curse cannot be dispelled or removed by anything short of divine interaction.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Driven by an obsession that few can fully comprehend, poludnicas are bitter creatures of light, heat, and envy. Although they are surprisingly strong and deadly combatants, these scythe-wielding women resort to violence only when guile and trickery have failed. They are lonely creatures that seek the company of mortals by luring farm workers and children away from their families so that they can brief ly enjoy a feeble simulation of family life. In the rural farming communities where her kind is most commonly found, a poludnica might also be known as Cornwife, Lady Midday, or Mother Noon. She might even be mistaken for a vengeful or beneficent ghost depending on how she presents herself.  Averaging 6 feet tall and weighing approximately 170 pounds, poludnicas could easily be mistaken for strapping farm girls if it were not for their radiance. Their maximum life expectancy has not been documented and it is commonly believed that poludnicas are effectively immortal unless they suffer some deadly mishap. It has been theorized that permanently keeping a poludnica in magically darkened conditions would eventually lead to her death, but no scholars have so far attempted to prove this hypothesis.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Poludnicas draw their physical sustenance from sunlight, but they often eat and drink to emulate the simple folk who are the subjects of their obsession. However, emotional nourishment is more difficult for them to obtain and their need for companionship and the simulation of a normal family life leads them to commit questionable acts of kidnapping or even murder.  Like bees who pollinate nearby flowers-which then go to seed and produce more flowers the next season-a poludnica's ability to enrich local plant life leads farming communities to thrive around their lairs. These plentiful fields bring more farmhands and more families, all potential companions for the poludnica.  Though the magic that pulls poludnicas into the Ethereal Plane at nightfall is viewed as a curse, it is also one of their most useful abilities. Though distressed and weakened on the Ethereal Plane, poludnicas can nonetheless perceive events upon the Material Plane. They often spend their nights spying on mortal families. Each night they move <i>ethereal</i>ly through mortals' homes, watching them eat, sleep, and enjoy the company and intimacy of others. Though this fills all poludnicas with sorrow, many are also driven to impotent, jealous rage as they watch children sleeping peacefully and wives embracing their husbands.  The origin of their cursed existence is a mystery- whether poludnicas were created by some powerful creature that did not anticipate the maddening effects of their abilities or whether they were once different creatures cursed for some failure or insult is not known. Either way, the curse has driven these lonely fey slightly mad.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Poludnicas usually claim a few hundred acres of fertile land as their territory, most often centered on a lair that is hidden in plain sight, inaccessible, or avoided by the community, such as a hollow beneath the tangled roots of a tree, the tumbledown barn of a former companion who no longer lives, or an abandoned and supposedly haunted farmhouse.  By day, a poludnica prowls crop fields seeking to lure, coerce, or physically abduct an overworked farmhand back to her home where she has built a mockery of a human farmhouse kitchen or bedroom, expecting her abductee to indulge her whims in a pantomime of normalcy, companionship, or intimacy. Sometimes one of these companions might choose to play along with his captor or try to escape during <i>daylight</i> hours, but those that bide their time until nightfall when the poludnica disappears at least have a chance of escape.  If a companion survives until nightfall, the poludnica fades away, leaving the suitor or child to fend for himself while she watches impotently from the Ethereal Plane. This may not prove to be a problem, but since many poludnicas make their daytime lairs in inaccessible places, if the captive cannot free himself before dawn, the poludnica often simply returns-likely unhappy with the \"inconsiderate\" companion's lack of loyalty to his new \"family.\"  Some poludnicas who are kinder than most choose to hide their presence altogether. They avoid coming into contact with the peasants working the land, except at night where they can invisibly and sorrowfully observe mortals enjoying the companionship that is denied to the poludnicas themselves. More commonly, poludnicas are driven to lure away farmhands and kidnap children who they believe will come to love them and consider them their new family.  For all the suffering poludnicas cause, dwelling in a poludnica's territory is not without its benefits. Their crop-enriching powers provide abundant food, and many farming communities have come to see them as a kind of guardian spirit. Children often weave cornhusk dolls to placate a local poludnica, ask for her protection, or thank her for sparing their fathers or brothers. Some poludnicas are touched by these displays and stop, or at least reduce, their predations on those in the community.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Reign_of_Winter.jpg","_id":"fC9zk8z6Iz1IrTGR"}

Whenever the ooze deals Constitution drain in this manner, it heals 10 hit points for each point of Constitution drained. Excess hit points above its normal maximum are gained as temporary hit points. A coven ooze can gain no more than 30 temporary hit points in this manner. If a coven ooze has temporary hit points when it splits, those temporary hit points are divided into its copies.  </p><p><strong>Hag Eye Ray (Sp)</strong> Every 1d4 rounds, each of the <i><i>hag eye</i>s</i> within a coven ooze can fire a magic ray at a target within 60 feet. Each <i>hag eye</i> emits a different spell effect: <i>bestow curse</i> (DC 17, -6 to Dexterity), <i>confusion</i> (DC 17, 9 rounds), <i>hold person</i> (DC 16, 9 rounds). All of these spell-like abilities function at CL 9th. The save DCs are Charisma-based, and include a +8 racial bonus.  </p><p><strong>Split (Ex)</strong> Slashing and piercing weapons deal no damage to a coven ooze. Instead, the creature splits into three identical oozes, each with one third of the original ooze's current hit points (round down). Upon splitting, each copy retains a single <i>hag eye</i> within its mass and can continue to use its <i>hag eye</i> ray ability, albeit with only one spell effect. A coven ooze with 10 hit points or fewer, or that doesn't have enough <i><i>hag eye</i>s</i> to result in each new ooze getting its own eye, cannot be split and instead takes damage normally.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Coven oozes result from a <i>hag eye</i> ooze's conglomeration of multiple <i><i>hag eye</i>s</i>, often caused by the destruction of a hag coven with a <i>hag eye</i> ooze nearby. With its controller gone, and no one to provide food, the ooze feeds upon its mistress and her coven sisters. Through this consumption, the creation gains some semblance of its creators' cunning, independent thought, and malignancy. If the coven sisters had <i><i>hag eye</i>s</i> of their own, the ooze absorbs them into its form. Otherwise, consumption of the coven, with the residual magic of the original <i>hag eye</i>, transforms one eye from each of the hags in the coven into a functional <i>hag eye</i>.  A coven ooze wanders its creator's territory, devouring any living organism it comes upon. With their animal intelligence, they use the terrain to their best advantage, often lying in waterways near frequented river crossings.  Coven oozes are generally 10 feet to a side and weigh roughly 1,500 pounds, although larger specimens have been encountered. When a coven ooze comes across another creature with the ooze subtype, it attempts to engulf and consume it. For every 10 HD of ooze creatures that a coven ooze consumes, its size increases by one step, to a maximum size of Gargantuan. If a coven ooze ever consumes a <i>hag eye</i> ooze, the creator of the <i>hag eye</i> ooze-if a hag-must succeed at a DC 25 Will save or have her connection to the <i>hag eye</i> ooze severed.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Reign_of_Winter.jpg","_id":"hhm81e4i7WvsZzWr"}

Their hatred is cold and seething, prone to suddenly snapping in an avalanche of ice and crushing blows. Birthed from the protomatter of the Abyss with natural gifts for tracking and subduing prey, they are sometimes used as trackers and jailors by more powerful demons who need to find lost prisoners and slaves.  From the waist up these demons are built much like strong, hairy humans or dwarves, but with exaggerated proportions resembling those of a gorilla. Their thick necks sport bristling manes that merge with the hair on their backs, and their flat faces bear two ramlike horns and cold eyes filled with hate. Their breath is a freezing fog, and their teeth are small but numerous, like a shark's. An andrazku's legs seem small in comparison to its torso, bend backward like a satyr's, and end in large cloven hooves. Their skin is the dead blue of a frozen corpse or a frost giant. Their top-heavy builds mean they have difficulty standing upright and normally assume a hunched posture; many prefer to walk and run on all fours, like apes. An andrazku is 7 feet tall at the shoulder and weighs 450 pounds.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  An andrazku forms from the soul of a chaotic mortal who hated women and used his or her power to oppress and demean them, such as a tyrant who selectively enforced laws against women, a priest who preached that women are the source of all sin, or a father who secretly beat his wives and daughters for their supposed failures. For this reason andrazkus are known to scholars as \"misogyny demons.\" Few of these souls dared to greater crimes (which would cause their souls to become incubi or babaus), nor were they once mortals who hated women but never acted upon their hatred-an andrazku only forms from a soul filled with suff icient hatred toward women to provoke action, but that is hampered by enough cowardice to prevent it from performing acts of greater evil. Most of them were male mortals, but an especially misogynistic evil female creature might become an andrazku in the Abyss.  An andrazku grows excited when it senses its prey's fear, but becomes frustrated if the hunt lasts for too long. Despite these demons' masculine appearance and aggression, most of them are impotent and some completely lack genitalia, rendering their lust pointless. Their nature is to berate, degrade, and beat; they tend to kill only when they feel an urge to eat, when their stymied passion becomes too great to tolerate, or when they are mocked for their shortcomings.  An andrazku prefers to attack with its bite and fists (often contemptuously slapping foes, minions, and prey with an open hand), but a vicious one may use a scourge and jagged-bladed sword as if pretending to be a balor. Sadistic and cruel, andrazkus have been known to chase down their prey, batter it for a while, and then release it, giving it enough of a head start that it thinks it has a chance of escaping. The andrazkus then track it down (using <i>locate creature</i> and <i>teleport</i>) to repeat the cycle again.  An andrazku in a position of authority likes to mark its minions and slaves with a scar on one side of the face indicating the demon's ownership. The demon typically uses its breath weapon to freeze a metal brand until it is cold enough to leave a permanent mark. If a slave is resistant or immune to cold, the demon uses a knife to carve its mark into one side of the creature's face.  Because of their long-simmering tempers and magical abilities, andrazkus are often called \"cold demons,\" and they mainly live in frigid Abyssal realms such as Jhuvumirak, home of demon lord Kostchtchie. Their intolerance of fire (despite their demonic resistance to it) and the cowardly nature of their origin-sin make them laughingstocks among demons (particularly babaus and incubi); as a result, andrazkus are sullen, resentful, and prone to take out their frustrations on weaker creatures- especially if said creatures are female.  Andrazkus prefer to lair in ice caves or tunnels dug out of hard-packed snow. Some take advantage of their cold immunity and strong swimming ability to live in simple shelters on ice floes. An andrazku's hooves and huge hands allow it to cling to ice as though it were rough stone, preventing it from slipping and allowing it to use much of the vertical space in its lair to store treasure and observe intruders.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Andrazkus loathe associating with more powerful female demons in any way, and curse under their breath at mariliths and similar demons of great stature. Among female demons of similar power, they are quick with clever words, believable boasts, and secret confessions of desire, but these are all lies to disguise the hatred crackling beneath the surface. If given the opportunity, an andrazku would capture and torture a succubus merely because she is female (though a succubus is physically more powerful than a lone misogyny demon, and the hairy brutes have to gang up to have any chance of defeating a \"weakling\" succubus). Succubi and mariliths are aware of these simple-minded feelings held by andrazkus and they delight in tormenting the brutish creatures. Those female demons know they hold greater strength and power than andrazkus, and they enjoy lording over the creatures, even going so far as to kidnap them from time to time, bringing them to their own lairs and forcing the creatures into servitude.  Andrazkus band together for strength, using their telepathy to silently coordinate their attacks. They often taunt their prey telepathically, either with words, promises of violence, or mocking laughter.  When set loose on the Material Plane, an andrazku usually forces itself into a position of power over a humanoid tribe. Some ally with frost giant tribes, especially those who worship Kostchtchie. Duller ones find better company among girallons and dire apes.  <br /><strong>Summoning Andrazku</strong><br />  Andrazkus are receptive to flattery about their size and strength. They like offers of weapons and strength-enhancing items as payment for their services. They can be assigned to guard, hunt, or retrieve; any Charisma check attempted as part a spell to convince an andrazku to undertake a mission other than these kinds of tasks takes a -2 penalty. A female <i>summon</i>er has a -10 penalty on all Charisma checks made to bargain unless the caster acts inferior and unworthy of the demon's aid.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Reign_of_Winter.jpg","_id":"iZRjXG8uHU3uzS01"}

Once every 1d4 rounds as a standard action, a kokogiak can expel a 60-foot cone of blistering arctic winds, dealing 8d6 points of cold damage to all creatures struck. A successful DC 23 Reflex save halves this damage. Any creature damaged by this attack must then succeed at a DC 23 Fortitude save or become fatigued (or exhausted if it was already fatigued). The save DCs are Constitution-based.  </p><p><strong>Forlorn Gaze (Su)</strong> As a standard action, a kokogiak can lock its black eyes on a target within 60 feet to fascinate the creature. A successful DC 20 Will save negates this effect. Creatures that fail the save are fascinated and they see they kokogiak as a lost loved one, trusted friend in danger, or ally in desperate need. Once a creature is fascinated, the kokogiak can compel the creature to move toward it. Once adjacent, the creature is flat-footed against the kokogiak's attacks, but the creature receives a new saving throw at the beginning of its turn to break the fascination. This is a mind-affecting effect and the save DC is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Ice Walker (Ex)</strong> A kokogiak takes no penalty to speed or on Acrobatics, Climb, or Stealth checks in snowy or icy terrain or weather conditions. It can walk across snow crusts or thin ice without breaking through. In addition, a kokogiak can choose to not leave tracks when moving in this type of terrain.  </p><p><strong>Penetrating Sight (Ex)</strong> A kokogiak's sight is not affected by its own <i>fog cloud</i> or <i>solid fog</i> spell-like abilities. In addition, a kokogiak does not take any penalties on Perception checks while its snowing.  </p><p><strong>Sound Imitation (Ex)</strong> A kokogiak can mimic any voice or sound it has heard by making a successful Bluff check against a listener's Sense Motive check.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>The kokogiak (called qupqugiaq by some tribes) is a deadly predator of the far northern wastes. At first glance, it appears to be a simple ravening beast or an enormous, unnaturally deformed polar bear, yet its raw power and cunning are legendary in the tales of northern nomads. Its name in some places is synonymous with cabin fever or deep-winter hallucinations that drive folk to desperation and madness, rushing out into the frozen wild in pursuit of some long-lost lover only to become lost themselves, victims of the kokogiak's dreadful might. Kokogiaks have an elongated neck, and are nearly 20 feet long from tail to nose. Over a dozen feet high at the shoulder, kokogiaks weigh between 6 and 8 tons.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Kokogiaks are amphibious in their habits, comfortable in and out of the water, though they are not able to breathe water as well as air. They spend a great deal of their time in the water, hunting seals, walruses, squids, and even whales in coastal waters and beneath the winter ice. While kokogiaks must surface periodically to breathe, their powerful claws enable them to rip through floating pack ice and make air holes nearly wherever they wish. Creating such air holes is actually a hunting technique- they lie in wait near the holes for seals and their ilk to surface to breathe, snatching their prey in their jaws and dragging it up onto the ice to feast. Kokogiaks also use the same trick in reverse, lurking underwater just below gaps in the ice and seizing prey traversing the ice above, or along rocky coastlines when the pack ice recedes. Even predatory creatures like polar bears and winter wolves might be dragged into the water to be drowned and devoured, and desperate kokogiaks are even known to scale arctic sea cliffs during spring thaws to feast on newborn seabirds and eggs, lapping up entire nests in a single flick of the tongue.  While they are well adapted to hunting in and around coastal icepacks, kokogiaks also roam far inland to prowl continental ice sheets. The same tactics kokogiaks use for hunting along the water's edge serve them well in the deep snowdrifts and icy spires and crevasses of the polar reaches. Kokogiaks scale rocky and icy peaks to lair in dens inaccessible to most creatures. From such high vantage points, they observe passersby; then, calling upon supernatural blinding fogs, they either descend upon their prey from above, snatching a target and dragging it to their elevated lairs, or burrow underneath and burst up from below, hauling prey into their frigid dens.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Kokogiaks live in cold arctic regions, though in winter they sometimes wander into the subarctic tundra and occasionally even into the colder latitudes of temperate climes. Those venturing so far south make their homes amid the glaciers and alpine wilderness of high mountains. While most return to the forever-winter of the arctic after taking their fill of warmer climes' abundant prey, a few make their homes permanently below the arctic circle, where their predations lend their mountain homes a deadly reputation. Such alpine kokogiaks descend with the winter storms into the huddled villages in the valleys below, luring the unwary to their doom and leaving a trail of death and terror in their wakes. In communities near a kokogiak's mountain, when the first heavy storms of winter strike, locals sometimes stake animals (or even rarely an unlucky member of the community, chosen by lottery) out in the cold in an attempt to propitiate the kokogiak's hunger and turn aside its wrath from the rest of the community.  Kokogiaks are more common in the subarctic and arctic, however, and they show no loyalty or preferential treatment to any that cross their path. They occasionally enter into alliances with creatures that will hunt for them and bring them living victims to torment and eviscerate at their leisure. They are cruel and capricious masters apt to turn on those who displease them in any way or just to ensure that others serving them do not doubt their power. More often, kokogiaks extract tribute from arctic and tundra dwelling tribes, sometimes in treasure but more often in the form of sacrifice. When refused, a kokogiak seeks to punish the unwilling by using its magic to inveigle members of that tribe to wander off from their homes and into the kokogiak's waiting clutches. Victims lured away in this fashion may simply be devoured, but the cruel beast often leaves behind bloodstained clothes or more grisly trophies torn from its victims' remains, artfully displayed for the friends and family of the deceased to find. So does the kokogiak remind them of the price of defiance.  Kokogiaks are mostly solitary, though mated pairs do sometimes join forces to spread terror wherever they roam or to take down powerful rivals. Kokogiak cubs are usually encouraged to fight one another for survival, struggling to show their dominance until only one remains. Weaklings are killed and eaten or driven out into the snows to survive or not. When the strongest cub approaches maturity, the kokogiak parents are faced with a choice: drive out the youngling when it is strong enough to survive but not yet strong enough to challenge its elders, or be prepared to face its challenge within the family group. Such challenges are usually directed at the parent of its own gender, as the youth seeks to drive out and take the place of its father or mother, proving its worthiness to take its surviving parent as its own mate.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Reign_of_Winter.jpg","_id":"iwaNEMxAxxWT0me4"}

The save DC is Constitution-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Believed to be native to the Parapet Mountains, wollipeds were among the first beasts of burden domesticated by Triaxians. Some claim wollipeds weren't domesticated initially to be working animals, but rather were herded and bred for their extremely warm and plentiful fleece. In any case, Triaxians have a long history of using these magnificent animals for many purposes, even employing them as mounts in battle. A typical wolliped stands between 5 and 6 feet at the front shoulder and weighs upward of 1,000 pounds.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Wollipeds are social herd animals that subsist on a diet of grasses, leaves, and other plant material. Wollipeds in high mountainous environments obtain much of their food from lichens and mosses, while herds of wollipeds on the plains graze on more substantial fare. Wild wollipeds tend to migrate to more plentiful foraging lands when winter comes to Triaxus, though these can be difficult to find. Domesticated wollipeds, tended to by their Triaxian herders, are found throughout nearly all of Triaxus.  Walking on eight sturdy legs, wollipeds are exceptionally sure-footed. These creatures can climb steep mountain trails and march through heavy snow with little effort, and Triaxian cavalry have often charged up scree-choked hillsides to raid fortresses on the backs of armored wollipeds. The great beasts' facility at maneuvering in challenging environments and generally submissive nature have resulted in a long relationship with the humanoids on Triaxus. Wollipeds live for about 15 years, mating and giving birth every 11 months, and can be ridden until the final month of pregnancy.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Wollipeds are social animals, grouping together into herds for protection. When threatened, wollipeds gather in a tight cluster with the young animals kept in the very center of the herd. Domesticated wollipeds are used for casual riding, pulling plows, and walking circles to power wollimills.  While other exotic fabrics are available during a Triaxian summer, the mainstay of Triaxian winter textiles is spun wolliped fleece. Wolliped fibers wick water away, and still provide adequate warmth even when soaked, while the variations in coat colors and textures provide a wide array of design options.  Like Triaxians, wollipeds exhibit distinct seasonal variance. Wollipeds born during the winter have long, thick, shaggy coats of fine fibers with a hollow core, while those born in the summers have shorter, thinner coats. Rather than the coats of individuals changing, the change happens generationally; winter wollipeds give birth to short-coated summer wollipeds as the planet warms, and vice versa. The process happens quickly, usually beginning in eastern Aylok, though no one knows precisely why.  In addition to wolliped fleece, some Triaxian artisans use the ivory from wolliped tusks as a raw material, but this is most common for wollipeds born during the winter, as their tusks are three times the size of those born in summer. Winterborn wollipeds use their foot-long tusks for a variety of purposes. In addition to using them to dig in the ice and snow for deep green tubers, burmoss, and patches of sentient tulbos fungus that stretches beneath the ice, wollipeds clash their tusks together in competitions for dominance within a herd and as part of their mating displays.  Wollipeds use spitting as a form of communication as well as for defense. Most wollipeds only spit at one another, typically in the course of their tusk-clashing shows of dominance, but when threatened they can launch a nauseating wad of partially digested fodder at their attackers. Some trained wolliped mounts have honed this nature into a weapon guided by their riders.  The dragons of Triaxus have little use for terrestrial mounts, and instead use wollipeds as a consistent source of food. More than half of all domesticated wollipeds eventually feed Triaxus's dragon population, though most wollipeds used for meat are older animals whose fleece has turned coarse and brittle. Triaxians also eat wolliped flesh, but most consider young and healthy animals too valuable to eat except during desperate winter years.  Regional Variants The statistics on the facing page represent the most common breed of wolliped native to the Drakelands, the Allied Territories, and the Skyfire Mandate. In addition to these, a multitude of other breeds exist throughout Triaxus.  Alurals: Triaxians of the Unbound Tribes breed the best wollipeds for battle, with their steeds recognized worldwide as being the strongest and most aggressive. Alurals are also the only known breed of wolliped that is carnivorous. Tribes here collect wolliped milk, fermenting it into a potent alcoholic beverage used for rituals, feasts, and holy days. Alurals have the advanced simple template.  Ningese Wollipeds: The remote nation of Ning breeds the smallest wollipeds on Triaxus. Ningese wollipeds are quick and nimble, using these traits to elude the hordes of monsters threatening the civilized regions of the nation. Wollipeds here are primarily used for fleece and food. In the summer, Ningese wollipeds grow to Medium size and their speed increases by 10 feet. Ningese wollipeds born in the harsh winter are Small and have 2 fewer Hit Dice; their Strength and Constitution decreases by 2, and their Dexterity increases by 2.  <br /><strong>Wolliped Companions</strong><br /> <strong>Starting Statistics: Size</strong> Medium; <strong>Speed</strong> 50 ft.; <strong>AC</strong> +1 natural armor, <strong>Attack</strong> gore (1d6); <strong>Ability Scores</strong> Str 14, Dex 16, Con 12, Int 2, Wis 11, Cha 4; <strong>Special Qualities</strong> low-light vision, scent.  <strong>7th-Level Adv.: Size</strong> Large; <strong>AC</strong> +3 natural armor; <strong>Attack</strong> gore (1d8); <strong>Ability Scores</strong> Str +4, Dex -2, Con +4; <strong>Special Abilities</strong> spit, trample.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Reign_of_Winter.jpg","_id":"jW5pWXcMVs8Ol8Ip"}

The effects of this ability are included in the herald's stat block.  </p><p><strong>Tactician (Ex)</strong> The herald has the tactician ability of a 17th-level cavalier (4/day, one teamwork feat, all allies within 30 feet, 11 rounds). She may use this ability with any of her teamwork feats (Lookout, Outflank, Swap Places).</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Courage Heart is a weapon against tyranny and a mighty spark that kindles the fires of hope in mortal hearts. Once a mortal ranger in the service of Milani, she was an early champion of Galt's Red Revolution when its purpose was to depose evil Chelish nobles, but when that movement become more about chaos and vengeance, she fought against it instead. Eventually branded a Chelish sympathizer by the Revolutionary Council, she allowed herself to be captured in order to allow her allies to escape. She was executed with a <i>final blade</i>, which trapped her soul within it.  Milani, having spent a century communicating directly with her followers, saw the merits of having a divine champion like other deities, and plucked the woman's soul from the artifact and made her a herald. Now the martyred hero keeps her original name secret so her living relatives in Galt do not become targets by association, and calls herself Courage Heart. Her mission is twofold: to attack the powerful enemies of the church (especially immortal undead who would subjugate the common folk and conjured outsiders used to strike fear into mortal hearts), and to inspire hope among mortals so they can find the strength to turn against tyrants.  As Courage Heart opposes slavery and unjust imprisonment, she has made it her personal crusade to steal all the <i>final blade</i>s and free the souls within them. Milani must look at the bigger picture, so the herald has to make progress toward this goal when she can. Courage Heart has been trying to get Pharasma's herald, the Steward of the Skein, to join her cause, as preventing souls from reaching the Boneyard is of interest to the Lady of Graves, but that herald's strange nature and the recent creation of the <i>final blade</i>s (relative to the history of civilization) means she has made little headway in establishing that alliance to date.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  As she has only been immortal for a few decades, Courage Heart still acts and feels like a mortal woman. She loves her homeland, cares deeply for her mortal relatives (most of whom have some elven blood and were alive when she was murdered), and enjoys worldly delights such as music and stories. Though she has an instinctive knowledge of the people and places near her, she has perfect recall of such things in Galt and feels great sorrow when she discovers that a building or person she knew in life has been destroyed or has died. She collects remnants of Galt's history, such as travel journals about its settlements, songs about its people, and sketches of its locations and inhabitants.  Having died for her beliefs holding no expectation of ever returning, Courage Heart considers it an honor to die again and again in her goddess' service, especially if doing so advances the cause or saves mortal lives. The only thing she fears is torture, but she knows her immortal flesh is resistant to punishment and she has magic at her disposal to help her escape almost any confinement.  Though she does not need to eat or drink, she still feels the urge to do so, and favors traditional Galtan food. A priest who calls her and has a Galtan meal ready for her is much more likely to get help than one who offers no such courtesy and expects immediate compliance.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Though the herald tries hard to not play favorites, she loves Galt and her extended family, and often checks up on her friends and relatives by lurking in mouse or owl form. Milani's small following and the herald's recent elevation to immortal <i>status</i> means they both are inclined to push the boundaries of what the divine laws allow for direct intervention on Golarion. To bypass these restrictions and watch over her revolution-corrupted homeland, Courage Heart often asks Milani to incarnate her as a mortal ranger (usually of 4th to 7th level) so she can lend a hand where she is needed.  In these incarnations she may be male or female and of nearly any human ethnicity or features, but she generally prefers light armor and wields a morningstar. In this mortal shell, she is more careful with her life-not out of any sense of self-preservation, but because she doesn't want her death to upset anyone she befriends. She prefers to show up in a settlement, deal with a problem, then leave before there are too many questions.  Among the other celestial servitors of Milani, Courage Heart is beloved as a comrade and leader. She often gathers teams of like-minded celestials to ambush and slay devils, undead, and minions of Zon- Kuthon, then retires with these comrades to Milani's realm in Elysium to tell stories of each other's bravery and virtue.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Reign_of_Winter.jpg","_id":"jojIqTPhNUUAzZRl"}

The largest males can weigh 175 pounds. Timber wolves typically have longer legs and bigger paws to help traverse the difficult terrain in which they live. More importantly, their proportionally larger heads, held up by powerful neck muscles, allow them to drag down sizable herd animals.  Hunts begin with a communal howl to unite the pack. They chase their prey over vast distances-sometimes over 50 miles-wearing prey down with fear and exhaustion. Using jaws capable of crushing bones and snapping spines, several timber wolves at a time might latch on to a victim and drag it to the ground. Their speed and pack instincts let them use coordinated attacks, flanking, and hit-and-run maneuvers.  Group howling helps bind the pack together. The howls can be used for calling the pack to the hunt, determining the location of other pack members, communicating food sources, and even determining social order. Howls can be heard over vast distances and help establish a pack's territory, which averages 350 square miles.  The power and majesty of timber wolves inspire many sentient races. For civilized folk, the wolf has come to embody a primitive evil, often playing the role of a villain in fairy tales. This has earned the animal an undeserved reputation for aggression. Among northern peoples, the wolf symbolizes strength and prowess in battle.

The resin grants a frost fir a +2 circumstance bonus on all disarm, grapple, and steal combat maneuvers, as well as on saving throws against effects that cause it to drop something it is holding. Any creature that is damaged by a frost fir's slam attack, deals damage to a frost fir with a natural weapon or unarmed attack, or otherwise touches a frost fir (including with a grapple maneuver), must succeed at a DC 13 Reflex save or be coated with the frost fir's sticky resin. A creature affected by this resin takes a -2 penalty on all attack rolls and concentration checks (penalties from multiple contacts do not stack). Any enemy grappled by a frost fir takes a -2 penalty on attempts to break the grapple and to escape using the Escape Artist skill. Strong alcohol, universal solvent, or any amount of fire damage dealt to a creature coated in resin removes the resin. The save DC is Constitution-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Little known outside the colder climes and higher elevations of the world, the malevolent tree creatures known as frost firs keep to themselves and disdain any who intrude upon their forested realms. Prevailing theories among scholars suggest the species descended from treants long ago, a derivative offshoot with an exclusive affinity for evergreen trees. But despite sharing a common language, frost firs actually disdain treants, citing philosophical differences. This revelation has caused others to posit that frost firs originated as an entirely separate species, born of the enigmatic First World where plants walk and speak as freely as other creatures.  The grim-minded frost firs are as cold and impassive as the windswept ice and rocks they call home. They care little for other creatures or societies, keeping their distance at all times and actively driving away any who dare to approach their groves during a reproductive cycle. Frost firs also have an especial hatred for those who create or rely upon open flames for warmth. Northern travelers often tell tales of frost fir attacks on their caravans, usually initiated with a smothering, snowy assault on any campfires. These attacks always come at night, and the frost firs never relent until such interlopers completely withdraw from their lands.  Frost firs make staunch combatants, specializing in stealthy forms of guerrilla warfare. They often utilize pit traps to capture the unwary, or draw their victims into ambushes facilitated by their ability to appear as normal trees. After grappling and pinning opponents, frost firs often take them prisoner and escort them back to a frost fir grove to be butchered and used to fertilize the soil for frost fir young. Frost firs craft any remaining bones into crude trophies and gruesome signposts marking their territory and warning away others. As a result, few species treat with frost firs, and any act of Diplomacy with them automatically faces a starting attitude of unfriendly.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Frost firs have no individual gender and reproduce asexually, developing both male and female cones that grow along their inner limbs near their thin torsos. The male cones produce pollen for the female cones, which close and gestate for a full year before the seeds are ready to sprout. To facilitate this process, frost firs often stand together on high outcroppings or in windswept passes during an especially reverent period they call Highwind. This allows a maximized sharing of pollen between multiple members of a grove, though a single frost fir can create its own offspring. Indeed, many groves have sprung from a lone frost fir capable of creating as many as six seed cones in a single reproductive cycle. Such progenitors often earn the title of Elder Fir among their own kind, which carries a significant status when representing the grove in external matters (see below).  Once a frost fir's fertilized cones fully mature, it clears an area of sacred ground, removing any residual snow or ice so it can plant its seedlings. Groves often band together to share in the responsibility of protecting these offspring, and aggressively defend such plots from intruders. Frost fir seedlings grow much like sprouting evergreen trees for their first two years, incapable of moving and sustained primarily by nourishment derived from the soil and sun. Caretakers of these seedlings refer to this time as the Loaming, and they often place carrion or other organic detritus around the grove to better fertilize the frigid soil and encourage more rapid growth. Some even hunt living creatures to ensure a supply of carcasses for this effort.  Following 2 years of sustained growth, a young frost fir finally becomes ambulatory enough to join the rest of the grove as a contributing member. Its lifespan extends about 50 years thereafter, and it can bear offspring for only about half that time. Occasionally, a frost fir's development remains stunted during the Loaming process and it fails to uproot itself. Such a child continues to grow as a regular evergreen tree, but never gains sentience. The frost firs often revisit sites where these trees grow to mourn their loss.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Frost firs form communal groves of no more than 12 members at a time, banding together until their numbers grow large enough for a group to separate and establish a new grove. They always make their homes in colder climes where other creatures are less plentiful, choosing the most inhospitable conditions in an effort to further deter intruders. Most frost firs prefer to keep their groves small to attract less attention, and purposefully separate into multiple groves to maximize the survival chances of their species. Only in times of great conf lict do multiple groves join forces. Such gatherings have given rise to legends of entire forests disappearing or growing up from an empty field overnight-usually followed by great devastation visited upon whatever stirred up the frost firs' ire.  Within frost fir society, Elder Firs carry a high degree of respect between groves, serving as representatives not only among their own kind, but also to the outside world. They coordinate reproductive cycles with other frost firs to replenish any losses a grove endures, and guide the decision-making regarding the establishment of new groves. Sometimes they grow larger than the other members of the grove, gaining the giant template while taking class levels in druid. Such leaders always select the Plant domain for their nature bond. Elder Firs who obtain the thousand faces class ability use the guises of Medium humanoids to spy upon and interact with nearby settlements to ensure no one encroaches on their lands.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Reign_of_Winter.jpg","_id":"mmjhT3BJC1JPuvlz"}

The ritual takes 10 minutes to perform and the target cannot have been dead longer than 1 day per Hit Die of the tombstone fairy. Additionally, the target's body must be present during the ritual and its soul must be available for return (if the target's soul is trapped, such as by a <i>trap the soul</i> spell, this ritual automatically fails).  A target unwilling to return to life can try to prevent its raising by attempting an opposed Charisma check against the tombstone fairy's Charisma check. If the tombstone fairy wins the opposed check, the target's soul is forced into its body and it returns to life. If the target wins the opposed check, it prevents its raising, and the tombstone fairy cannot attempt to raise that target for 1 month.  During the ritual, a portion of the target's soul transfers to its funeral shroud or cloth. The tombstone fairy often retains this shroud so as to force compliance from the returned target. Once the target does what the fairy desires, the tombstone fairy finishes this ritual and transfers the last bit of the target's soul from the shroud into its body. If the funeral shroud is destroyed while it contains a part of the target's soul, the target instantly dies and can only be returned to life through the use of a <i>miracle</i>, <i>resurrection</i>, <i>true <i>resurrection</i></i>, or <i>wish</i>. This ability otherwise resembles a <i>raise dead</i> spell. A tombstone fairy can have only one funeral shroud containing a target's soul in its possession at one time.</p></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Reign_of_Winter.jpg","_id":"nIn3fghA96KgLswd"}

A creature granted good luck gains a +2 luck bonus on all saving throws, attack rolls, and skill checks, while a creature afflicted with bad luck takes a -4 penalty on all saving throws, attack rolls, and skill checks.
