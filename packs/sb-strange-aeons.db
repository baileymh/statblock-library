Originally bats mutated by mad derros to enhance their natural abilities, the wrigglers have slowly evolved to their current form. A wriggler's wormlike body is supported between anywhere from two and six wings, four to eight legs, and possibly a collection of tails. Each creature  lacks a head, and instead has merely a pair of grotesque nostrils, which create the trademark sound that both aids it in hunting and overwhelms its prey's senses.  These creatures aren't terribly dangerous individually, but meet any disturbances in their territory with swift and often deadly investigation. The creatures immediately swarm any intruders, trying to learn their scent from as close as possible. They seem driven more by curiosity than animosity, but the resultant battering and probing can occasionally prove fatal. Pallid wrigglers are herbivores, feeding on the fungus that is ubiquitous in their cavernous lairs, so creatures slain by their attentions often rot away unless eaten by another scavenger.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Strange_Aeons.jpg","_id":"1fMF2GynqMV1one3"}

An undead creature can consume a kudimmu's bloodfruit in place of whatever bodily material it normally hungers for, whether blood, flesh, or something else. Doing so temporarily sates the undead creature's hunger, but does not provide any other benefits normally gained from consumption. Upon consuming bloodfruit, an undead creature must succeed at a DC 25 Will saving throw or fall under the kudimmu's  control, as per <i>control undead</i>. A living creature treats bloodfruit as a drug with the following statistics (see page 236 of the <i>Pathfinder RPG GameMastery Guide</i> for full rules on drugs and <i>addiction</i>): <i>type</i> ingested; <i>addiction</i> severe, Fortitude DC 25; <i>effects</i> 1 hour; +2 alchemical bonus on saving throws against necromancy spells and <i>effects</i>, <i>fester</i> as per the spell (caster level 24th); <i>damage</i> 1d4 Con. The save DC is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Bombardment (Su)</strong> A kudimmu can produce bloodfruit from its body, which are charged with negative energy and can be thrown as splash weapons. These bloodfruit deal 8d6 points of negative energy <i>damage</i> on a direct hit, and 8 points of <i>damage</i> to creatures adjacent to the targeted square. A successful DC 25 Will saving throw halves this <i>damage</i>. The save DC is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Create Spawn (Su)</strong> A creature killed by the kudimmu's blood drain ability or by Constitution <i>damage</i> accrued through consuming bloodfruit rises as a vampire spawn under the kudimmu's control 1d4 days later. A kudimmu can have a number of enslaved spawn totaling at most double its own Hit Dice; any spawn it creates that would exceed this limit become free-willed undead.  </p><p><strong>Fieldbound (Ex, Sp, Su)</strong> A kudimmu can designate an area of natural vegetation up to 100 feet by 100 feet per side as its field, fusing the root systems of the area's plants into an interconnected mass. While in physical contact with the ground of its field, a kudimmu gains fast healing 15, tremorsense, and a 15-foot burrow speed. Additionally, the kudimmu can teleport to any location in its field as per <i>dimension door</i>. Spells and <i>effects</i> that attempt to alter the field's earth or vegetation must overcome the kudimmu's spell resistance to succeed.  The kudimmu is physically dependent on its field, as the root system beneath it is in many ways an extension of the kudimmu's body. A kudimmu separated from its field for more than 24 hours instantly decays into a lump of inanimate matter. A kudimmu that is slain or destroyed reforms in the ground beneath its field in a process that takes 1d10 days to complete. To prevent a kudimmu from reviving, its field must be sown with salt or destroyed by magic (merely destroying the surface plants is not sufficient-the roots must also be entirely destroyed).  A kudimmu must maintain its field with the blood of the living. The field must soak up the blood of a Medium or larger creature once per week. For each week the kudimmu fails to feed its field, it takes 2 points of Constitution <i>damage</i>. This <i>damage</i> cannot be healed until the kudimmu feeds its field. A kudimmu can designate a new field once per month in a process that takes 1 hour to complete. It can have only one active field at a time.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>When a city is destroyed, it is customary for the conquering army to sow salt or thorns to render the ground forever infertile and curse those who would dare to rebuild. In most cases, this is simply a symbolic gesture. However, this  ritual has eminently practical roots. Death and devastation are potent seeds, and the blood of conquered peoples can mingle with the roots of burned fields to produce terrible creatures. These are called kudimmus, twisted weeds that corrupt the ground of vanquished cities and exact a terrible price upon invaders.  A kudimmu's body is diffused throughout its field, and it can weigh tens of thousands of pounds. Its primary fruiting body is vaguely humanoid in shape, standing 10 feet tall and weighing 4,000 pounds.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Most of the fruit a kudimmu produces is tainted by sinister magic. While this does not affect the taste or nutritional value of the fruit, it does leave them misshapen and renders any seeds inside dead. Kudimmus can, however, produce viable fruit should they choose to do so. These fruit are identical to their normal bloodfruit in every way, except that the seeds of these fruit sprout into new kudimmus if planted into unconsecrated ground. Kudimmus rarely use this ability, as more kudimmus in the world means more competition for food. However, if a kudimmu feels its life is threatened or it knows it will soon be attacked, it can send one of its undead minions to plant its seeds in a distant field to ensure the continuation of its line.  These monstrous plants require fresh sources of blood for their fields and thus prey on humanoid settlements to survive. Some kudimmus can make do with the blood of animals for a short time, but they do not find this subsistence living agreeable and almost always seek out farms or other civilized places to make their homes. Some kudimmus consume communities without care and live nomadic lives, always searching for fresh hunting grounds. Other kudimmus are more cautious and cunning, cultivating humanoid populations much as farmers tend to their crops.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Once a kudimmu establishes itself in a field, it uses its addictive bloodfruit to conquer nearby settlements. If the local populace seems unwilling to eat the misshapen fruit, the kudimmu may leave  its field at night to poison other fields and bring about a famine. Once one or two individuals fall under the kudimmu's control, it sends its new vampiric minions to strong-arm or convert the town's leadership.  Competition for feeding grounds keeps kudimmus from cooperating with each other. In fact, kudimmus often squabble over territory. As kudimmus are usually unwilling to leave their fields and fight powerful rivals on their own, these wars are fought through proxies, often the kudimmus' vampiric minions.  As kudimmus prey on humans, so too do the undead prey on kudimmus. Usually this is to the plants' benefit, as any undead that feed on their fruit eventually fall under their spell and strengthen their influence over the countryside. However, particularly strong-willed undead can resist the <i>effects</i> of kudimmus' bloodfruit and exploit the plants as an alternative to hunting humanoids.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Strange_Aeons.jpg","_id":"1mHWKznGIOFVHO6x"}

As a full-round action before casting a spell with an expensive material component, Mother Grim Moon can open herself to the madness of the multiverse to ignore the required material component. However, for every 500 gp worth of material components she ignores, she has a cumulative 5% chance of developing a debilitating madness or physical  malady equivalent to the effects of <i>bestow curse</i>; these effects are permanent and can be removed only with <i>miracle</i> or <i>wish</i>. Mother Grim Moon already suffers from three such afflictions: one reduces her Strength by 6, another causes her to grow painful bone spurs that prevent her from wearing armor, and the third muddles her senses in combat, giving her a 25% chance each round of performing no actions. These afflictions reduce her effective Challenge Rating by 2. In place of sacrificing her well-being, she can instead destroy magic items or valuables whose market price is at least twice the cost of the material component. Such items crumble into nonmagical ash after Mother Grim Moon finishes casting the spell, and only <i>miracle</i> or <i>wish</i> can restore them.</p></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Strange_Aeons.jpg","_id":"64O6iJ3HmBksFcrd"}

Anyone who attempts to cast a spell with the light descriptor in this area must succeed at a DC 30 caster level check, or the spell is lost as if it had been counterspelled.  </p><p><strong>Dreams of Darkness (Ex)</strong> Mordiggian can affect a creature that has been restored to life by a worshiper of Mordiggian, that has suffered negative energy damage while within the walls of a temple devoted to Mordiggian, or that has been in the area of effect of Mordiggian's unspeakable presence (whether or not the creature was affected by it) with dreams of darkness. When Mordiggian uses his <i>nightmare</i> spell-like ability on such a target, the victim endures what seems to be the passage of hundreds of years imprisoned in a lightless sarcophagus or coffin. Upon waking, the creature takes an additional effect beyond the normal effects of <i>nightmare</i>-it must succeed at a DC 40 Fortitude saving throw or contract an accelerated form of ghoul fever that inflicts its damage every hour instead of every day. This is a death effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Eldritch Insight (Ex)</strong> The whispers of all the world's dead echo in Mordiggian's mind, and as a result, he adds his Wisdom modifier as an insight bonus to his Armor Class and on all Initiative checks. If Mordiggian is on a planet or in a dimension where no creature has ever died, this ability does not function.  </p><p><strong>Engulf (Su)</strong> When Mordiggian engulfs a creature, he inflicts 20d6 points of negative energy damage and 1d4 negative levels. A successful DC 44 Reflex saving throw halves the negative energy damage, and a DC 44 Fortitude save removes the negative levels. The save DCs are both Constitution-based.  </p><p><strong>Great Old One Traits</strong> Rules for Mordiggian's Great Old One traits such as immortality, insanity, and otherworldly, as well as the rules for his mythic abilities and unspeakable presence can be found on page 306 of <i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 4</i>.  </p><p><strong>Immortality (Ex)</strong> If Mordiggian is killed, the shadows that comprise his body lose all form and become a 20-foot-diameter roiling blot of churning darkness with a 300-foot fly speed and perfect maneuverability. This blot of darkness is incorporeal and cannot be harmed, but it cannot enter an area of bright light. The blot can sense  all undead creatures within a 100-mile radius, and if it finds an undead creature, it can attempt to infuse it. An intelligent undead can resist this attack with a successful DC 40 Will saving throw; unintelligent undead receive no save. Once this blot of darkness infuses an undead creature, it grants the undead creature the advanced creature simple template, but 24 hours later, the undead is destroyed, releasing a fully-healed Mordiggian back into the world. If Mordiggian cannot find a suitable undead host within 24 hours or is trapped by bright light for that duration, the blot of darkness fades away, only to manifest immediately on another world-perhaps in the distant past, in the distant future, or even in the present. The save DC is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Tentacles (Su)</strong> Mordiggian's tentacles are primary attacks that inflict bludgeoning damage. He adds his Charisma modifier to damage done by his tentacles, which also gain a +5 enhancement bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls. These tentacles are treated as magic epic chaotic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. If Mordiggian reduces a living creature to fewer than 0 hit points with a tentacle or with his constriction damage, he automatically casts <i>death knell</i> on the target as a free action.  </p><p><strong>Unspeakable Presence (Su)</strong> Failing a DC 40 Will saving throw against Mordiggian's unspeakable presence causes the victim to become permanently blinded. A creature that is killed while blinded by this ability immediately animates as a chaotic evil juju zombie (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2</i> 291). The save DC is Charisma-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Called the Charnel God by his worshipers, Mordiggian is one of the oldest and most powerful of the Great Old Ones. However, his tendency to move back and forth in time whenever he reincarnates makes the tracking of his age largely academic. None can say how long Mordiggian has existed, for as far as one can look back into the past or forward into the future, the presence of his cult can be found if one searches hard enough.  Mordiggian has no body. He appears as a cloud of mobile, malevolent darkness and shadow that can change its outline and shape at will. He is fond of appearing as an immense graveworm or limbless giant made of darkness, and when he desires a meal, he can form tentacles of solid darkness to pluck up his feast.  Ghouls, particularly those that dwell in Leng, often venerate Mordiggian with a ferocious zeal. They consider ghoulish worshipers  of other deities, particularly of the demon lord Kabriri, to be heretics and work to eradicate such blasphemers whenever they are found. Although worship of Mordiggian has become quite rare on Golarion as other death gods have gained more prominence, his cult is patient and willing to simply wait for the Charnel God's inevitable return to power.  <br /><strong>Mordiggian's Cult</strong><br />  Mordiggian's worshipers venerate him as a death god, and his worship is openly allowed in some cities. In these cases, his temple also serves to dispose of all of the city's dead, yet the faithful's exact method for dealing with corpses is subject to fearful whispers among the nonbelievers. His temples consist of either underground vaults hidden below graveyards or towering cathedral-like structures containing mazes of rooms. Mordiggian grants access to the domains of Chaos, Darkness, Death, and Evil, and to the subdomains of Entropy (<i>Pathfinder Campaign Setting</i>: <i>Inner Sea Gods</i> 224), Loss, Night, and Undead.

Thin, often matted hair tops a drexin's scalp. Its light-starved, wizened flesh stretches taut across its bones, and its claws brush the ground as it walks. An average drexin stands 3 feet tall and weighs 25 pounds.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Many gremlins believe that drexins were once nuglubs or jinkins who strayed too far underground. It's thought that after wandering into the twisted lands of Orv, these poor creatures stumbled upon a cabal of neothelids and were taken prisoner. Years in the massive worms'  captivity both warped the gremlins' appearances and enhanced their minds. These lost gremlins became the drexins. The altered creatures emerged from the depths with new psychic abilities and an understanding of the neothelids' aberrant tongue. Perhaps the drexins escaped through sheer luck; perhaps their ascension to the upper levels of the Darklands is part of the machinations of the alien monstrosities in the deep heart of the world. Of course, the entire story is mere conjecture, and drexins quite possibly developed their psychic talents independent of neothelid influence.  As their enlarged craniums suggest, drexin gremlins are particularly intelligent and have psychic talents that they gleefully employ to befuddle and maim the minds of others. While other gremlins revel in breaking objects, drexins enjoy tinkering with and disrupting thoughts, breaking the wills and minds of their targets rather than dismantling them physically.  Drexins delight in sneaking up on spellcasters or artisans and using abilities such as <i>babble</i>, <i>id insinuation I</i>, and <i>mental block</i> to disrupt the process of spellcasting or magic item creation. If the victim senses the drexin's presence, the drexin typically casts <i>mind thrust I</i> or telekinetically flings an available object at the creature before fleeing. Drexins are physically weak and abhor physical combat unless they have a powerful ally to hide behind. This cowardice usually confines drexins to the sidelines of a fight.  Like all gremlins, drexins are skilled trapsmiths. A drexin can imbue its traps with its own psychic spells. These masterpieces far surpass the mechanical devices made by other types of gremlins. Drexins are fond of creating and setting snares outside places of study, magic shops, and mages' homes. If a target springs the trap, the drexin emerges to torment its victim while she lies incapacitated, just outside the reach of aid. Drexins especially like to target other psychic creatures in this way, particularly those that are too powerful to confront directly. While drexins crave additional psychic power, most are incapable of more than a few spells. These wretched creatures therefore envy those who master the occult.  From time to time, a drexin appears to a spellcaster or psychic and offers its services, usually proposing to increase the security of that person's home or workshop by building a number of traps in exchange for certain knowledge. Anyone foolish enough to accept the drexin's terms enjoys the benefits of a loyal trap crafter for a time. All too soon, however, the drexin gains the knowledge it seeks or grows bored with the arrangement. The unfortunate master returns to his home or study only to fall into the traps that once kept his secrets safe. The drexin then either kills or disables its former employer before stealing anything valuable and retreating to the sewers.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Among gremlinkind, drexins are feared for their mastery of mental magic. Different varieties of gremlins grudgingly cooperate with drexins to terrorize other creatures, but regard the psychic gremlins with intense distrust. Jinkins, pugwampis, and vexgits are even known to put aside their aversion to cold iron and construct \"mind shields\"-simple helms or plates of cold iron that are fastened around the head with straps to prevent drexins' psychic intrusions. These items do nothing to stop drexins' intrusions, but popular gremlin opinion keeps them in use. The fact that drexins speak Aklo as well as Undercommon further contributes to their otherness in gremlin society.  In the Darklands, some lesser creatures believe drexins are capable of mental possession. The average drexin cannot truly dominate the mind or spirit, but individuals encourage this rumor, desiring the fearsome reputation it brings. Some drexins, however, grow more powerful than their kindred and gain class levels in kineticist or psychic. These drexins are particularly influential in gremlin society, and often command their own mobs of drexins or even other gremlins, who serve them out of fear and necessity rather than respect. Advanced drexins occasionally infiltrate humanoid society, enticing curious minds to explore mysteries best left undisturbed. Behind many academics who delve too deeply into maddening ancient secrets and spellcasters who open cursed magical tomes is an ambitious drexin joyfully luring others into psychic peril.  Drexins prefer to dwell in the subterranean world, usually making their homes in caves and underground ruins. These gremlins commonly reside in the Darklands, and can be found among the slaves of the drow and serpentfolk of Sekamina. Drexins also form their own loosely organized societies in Nar-Voth, alongside jinkins, nuglubs, and vexgits. Still, the buzzing energy of thousands of minds in close proximity draws drexins to surface cities, where they often infest abandoned buildings and sewers.  Though drexins usually betray their allies, occasionally creatures forge successful partnerships with these fey. Frauds claiming a connection to the spirit world or the minds of others sometimes use a hidden drexin's abilities to con patrons out of their hard-earned coin. A drexin might enter such a deal spurred by the promise of shared knowledge or gifts of materials to augment trap crafting. Ultimately, to avoid falling victim to a drexin's backstabbing, a drexin's partner must be just as conniving and cruel as the gremlin itself. Such a worthy creature might inspire a feeling akin to friendship in the drexin. If the partner ever double-crosses the drexin, however, the arrangement ends.  Drexins do not hold grudges; rather, they cultivate and nurture them over time, never forgetting the face or name of a betrayer. A drexin is a patient creature and may wait years to exact its revenge.  Drexins are proud gremlins and do not typically worship deities or acknowledge any force greater than themselves. Contrary to their nature, however, some drexins pay homage to a being reverently named \"The Taker.\" This entity urges drexins to increase their own mental abilities by stealing the power of others, usually through a gruesome ritual in which the gremlin ingests portions of the brain of a murdered spellcaster or psychic. Drexins who follow The Taker typically dispatch their victims via traps, poison, or strangulation while those unfortunate souls sleep. While The Taker is not a deity and cannot grant spells to clerics, drexin oracles and shamans serve as the being's prophets and emissaries among drexin populations. Whether The Taker is an aspect of another deity, a powerful but mortal being with nefarious plans, or the creation of the gremlins' wild imaginations remains unknown.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Strange_Aeons.jpg","_id":"8JeAh48tforPysT2"}

If her mote hits the target, she can do one of three things: deal 10d6 points of force and negative energy damage, affect the target with the equivalent of a violent thrust use of <i>telekinesis</i> (15 objects, +39 attack roll), or affect the target with the equivalent of <i>reverse gravity</i> (DC 33 negates). The save DC is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Breach Reality's Fabric (Su)</strong> Three times per day, Cassilda may select a point within 60 feet. A black sphere with a corona of <i>light</i> opens like a hole in reality. The squares in a 40-foot burst around this point become difficult to move in, but only when a creature is moving away from  the point. When a creature is moving away from the point, each square of movement counts as three squares. Every round that a creature is within the area of the burst, it is drawn toward the point at the start of its turn. A DC 33 Reflex save halts this movement for 1 round; if this save fails, the creature is automatically pulled into the hole and takes 10d6 points of negative energy damage (Fortitude DC 33 half). A creature in the hole takes the same amount of damage at the start of its turn. A creature in the hole no longer occupies a square but instead occupies an extradimensional space. A successful DC 33 Reflex save allows a creature to exit the hole. Cassilda is unaffected by this ability but must maintain concentration on the effect or it ends at the start of her next turn. The save DC is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Force of Will (Su)</strong> Cassilda adds her Charisma modifier as a deflection bonus to her Armor Class.  </p><p><strong>Immortal (Su)</strong> Cassilda is immune to all aging effects. Furthermore, she is difficult to destroy, even for Hastur. Upon her death, she is painfully reborn in her palace at the heart of Carcosa in 1d6 days. She can be permanently destroyed only by the destruction of her <i>Imperial</i> <i>Diadem</i>.  </p><p><strong>Spells (Sp)</strong> Cassilda has a limited selection of spells known, but she casts spells as a 20th-level psychic. The save DCs for her spells are Charisma-based.</p></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Strange_Aeons.jpg","_id":"8zuzxlX0tm0WqbNz"}

A living being of Ib is not a very dangerous creature, but those who gain levels in spellcasting classes can become quite formidable; they overwhelmingly prefer divine spellcasting classes and typically venerate Bokrug.  <br /><strong>Being of Ib Characters</strong><br /> Living beings of Ib are defined by their class levels-they do not have racial Hit Dice. All living beings of Ib have the following racial traits. They are Medium-sized aberrations. A being of Ib is a 14-point race if you use the <i>Pathfinder RPG Advanced Race Guide's</i> race builder rules.  <br /><strong>-4 Strength, -2 Constitution, +4 Wisdom:</strong> Beings of Ib are frail and weak, yet profoundly faithful and devoted.  <br /><strong>Aquatic:</strong> A being of Ib is aquatic. It can move in water without attempting Swim checks and can breathe underwater. It always treats Swim as a class skill.  <br /><strong>Darkvision:</strong> A being of Ib has darkvision to 60 feet.  <br /><strong>Low-Light Vision:</strong> A being of Ib can see twice as far as a human in dim light.  <br /><strong>Amphibious:</strong> A being of Ib is able to survive indefinitely on land.  <br /><strong>Speed:</strong> A being of Ib has a land speed of 20 feet and a swim speed of 30 feet.  <br /><strong>Amorphous:</strong> Although a being of Ib's body is solid and it cannot adjust its shape, its slimy skin and internal structures (skeleton and organs alike) are strangely composed of the same alien matter. This lack of any real single weak point means that the being of Ib is immune to precision damage (such as sneak attacks) and critical hits.  <br /><strong>Voiceless:</strong> See the stat block on page 86.  <br /><strong>Languages:</strong> A being of Ib cannot speak, but is entirely capable of learning and understanding languages. The creatures' language, Ib, is a combination of hand gestures and facial expressions.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Strange_Aeons.jpg","_id":"9lYee7p2fcjShwxL"}

A new saving throw is required each round until the creature fails or is no longer within range. The Yellow King can suppress or resume this ability as a free action. This is a gaze effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Sleep Song (Su)</strong> As a full round action, the Yellow King can sing a lullaby that puts nearby creatures to <i>sleep</i>. Any creature within 100 feet of the Yellow King that can hear his song must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC = the Yellow King's Perform [sing] check result), or fall a<i>sleep</i> as per <i>sleep</i> for 4 rounds. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected by the Yellow King's <i>sleep</i> song again for 24 hours. Dream creatures are immune to their own and other dream creatures' <i>sleep</i> songs. Sleep song is a sonic, mind-affecting <i>sleep</i> effect.  </p><p><strong>Sleep Vulnerability (Ex)</strong> The Yellow King takes a -2 penalty on saving throws against <i>sleep</i> effects. Furthermore, he counts as a creature with 2 fewer Hit Dice than he actually has for the purpose of determining the number and Hit Dice of creatures a <i>sleep</i> spell can affect.  </p><p><strong>Waking Dreams (Su)</strong> At will as a standard action, the Yellow King can cause the area within 100 feet of his position to become hazy and dreamlike. This effect penetrates solid objects and even crosses the boundary with the Ethereal Plane. Distances and speeds in the affected area become hard to judge. Bright areas seem dark, and dark areas appear to have some hazy illumination. Colors blend into one another in strange and unpredictable ways, and creatures seem to take on the features of other creatures or objects. Every creature in the affected area takes a -4 penalty on all attack rolls, checks, and saving throws as long as it remains in the area. A creature outside the area taking any action that would affect creatures within or on the other side of the area also takes a -4 penalty on any associated roll or check. Waking dreams is an illusion (figment) effect with no saving throw, but creatures that are immune to illusion effects are immune to this effect. <i>True seeing</i> and similar effects allow a creature to act in the affected area without taking the penalty. Dream creatures are immune to the penalties caused by their own waking dreams and by those of other dream creatures.</p></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Strange_Aeons.jpg","_id":"AeZ5oL9ExgLvf1Pa"}

A shrike worm gains a bonus on saving throws against illusion spells and effects equal to its Charisma bonus, and it does not need to examine or interact with an illusion in order to attempt a saving throw to disbelieve it.  </p><p><strong>Impale (Ex)</strong> If a shrike worm begins its turn with a creature grappled with its tentacles, it can attempt a grapple combat maneuver check as a free action to try to impale the grappled creature on one of the spines on its back. If the shrike worm succeeds, the grappled creature takes 6d6+18 points of damage and is pinned. Once a creature is impaled, it loses the grappled condition and the shrike worm can use all of its tentacles without penalty. A shrike worm can have  up to six Medium or smaller creatures impaled on its spikes at a time. An impaled creature can remove itself from a spine by succeeding at a combat maneuver or Escape Artist check as normal. A creature that is removed from a shrike worm spine (either by its own efforts, those of its allies, or magic) takes 3d6 points of bleed damage and is sickened for 1d4 rounds.  </p><p><strong>Impossible Form (Su)</strong> Any creature within 100 feet of the shrike worm that can see it must succeed at a DC 27 Will saving throw or become fascinated for as long as the creature remains within range of this ability. A creature that fails its save believes the shrike worm is a hallucination or an illusion; the shrike worm's approach does not constitute an obvious threat and does not break this fascination effect. The fascination effect ends as normal if the shrike worm attacks or interacts with the affected creature or its allies. A creature that saves against a shrike worm's impossible form aura is immune to it for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Phantasmal Slime (Sp)</strong> As a standard action that doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity, a shrike worm can spew from its mouth a 30-foot cone of scintillating color that infects the minds of those it touches. This functions as per <i>phantasmal web</i> (DC 21), except that a creature that fails its save believes it is caught in threads of sticky, luminous slime infested with diminutive shrike worm larvae. The shrike worm can use this ability once every 1d4 rounds. A creature that realizes the slime is illusory gains a +4 bonus on saves to resist subsequent uses of this ability.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Shrike worms are insidious creatures from the edges of reality, and are able to blur the boundary between what is real and unreal in order to take their prey by surprise. Also known as hallucination worms, they are most often called shrike worms due to the method by which they kill their prey. When a shrike worm catches a creature in its tentacles, it then impales its victim on its iridescent back spines, pinning the creature in place in order to prolong its prey's suffering as much as possible.  Shrike worms grow to over 25 feet long and, despite weighing upward of 16,000 pounds, carry themselves about with surprising grace on their long legs. This lends their movements an unearthly quality, which is further enhanced by their magical abilities.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Shrike worms are superficially similar to mundane velvet worms, though they are much larger and exhibit a cruel intelligence that their mundane cousins lack. Much like velvet worms can spray sticky slime to capture prey or fend off predators, shrike worms can emit phantasmal slime, which entangles and sickens the weak minded. Shrike worms use this ability when overwhelmed or surprised, trapping potential aggressors in their own delusions until the shrike worms can either regain the upper hand or flee.  However, shrike worms' primary hunting tool is their bizarre appearance. Shrike worms are so strange looking and so suffused with illusion magic that they appear to be illusions to most creatures. The worms take advantage of this trait to keep potential prey from fleeing or attacking before the worms can move into an ideal attack position. A worm's victim realizes its error only in time to feel the worm's grasping tentacles lifting it toward the terrible spines along the creature's back.  Much like shrikes, shrike worms impale their prey because they have trouble consuming fresh corpses. Their mouths are small and poorly adapted to chewing through skin and bone, so they impale their prey on their back spines and wait for it to decompose and soften. This can take some time, particularly as creatures may not die immediately upon being impaled-but the shrike worm is capable of going without food for long stretches of time and does not mind waiting for its dinner to ripen. Even when more palatable food is available, shrike worms prefer to hunt hardier creatures, for they savor the suffering that comes with the creatures' prolonged and painful deaths.  Shrike worms do not reproduce sexually and have no gender. When a shrike worm achieves sufficient size, it splits itself, producing two identical offspring. These two spawn shrike worms are ravenous upon formation, and usually part ways so as not to compete for food as they mature. However, sibling shrike worms often seek each other out once they've reached adulthood, almost as though they feel incomplete in each other's absence.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Though they are often encountered alone due to their rarity, shrike worms are not overly solitary creatures. They seem to enjoy each other's company, although it isn't clear whether, or to what extent, they can communicate. Their fondness for company may be a matter of hygiene, as groups of shrike worms preen each other, picking pieces of bone and rotting flesh from the gaps in their carapaces. In this way, shrike worms display their social hierarchy, with the oldest and strongest worms being the recipients of the most attention from their peers.  Shrike worms lair in remote places, often seeking out areas exposed to powerful or long-lasting illusions. For example, permanent <i>hallucinatory terrain</i> or  large <i>illusory wall</i> effects attract shrike worms like moths to a flame. Shrike worms are also often found in areas afflicted by legacies of madness, such as abandoned insane asylums or villages destroyed by plagues of mental illness. Some believe that shrike worms are actually responsible for such bouts of insanity, claiming that repeated exposure to the sight of the impossible worms can shatter minds and drive people mad.  While shrike worms enjoy each other's company a great deal, they treat almost all other creatures as mere food. They understand Aklo and are willing to deal with wicked fey or other powerful tricksters, but they never offer their services to such creatures for free. Those who wish to employ a shrike worm's abilities must pay, usually by providing the worm a steady supply of victims.  Derros are an exception to this trend. As creatures of madness, derros attract shrike worms whenever they dwell in one place for too long or build large communities. While some shrike worms simply devour the derros en masse, cleverer worms take advantage of their ability to dominate the smaller creatures and instate themselves as false gods among the derros. These shrike worms use their illusory magic to answer their subjects' prayers and to relay their commands, and they tend to grow fat and lazy as the derros supply live sacrifices to placate their strange and impossible gods.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Strange_Aeons.jpg","_id":"CNAJqdZ6yC6mtnwW"}

A foe that is normally immune to poison can be affected by Atlach-Nacha's poison in this way, but the victim treats the poisoning as if it had been injected with only 1 dose.  </p><p><strong>Dreams of Futility (Su)</strong> Atlach-Nacha can impose its verminous dreams on any creature that has been rendered unconscious at any point in its life as a result of spider venom, that has come in contact with the Great Old One's webs, or upon whom Atlach-Nacha has fed. When Atlach-Nacha uses <i>nightmare</i> on such a target, the victim must also succeed at a DC 35 Will saving throw or become overwhelmed with futility. Whenever the victim attempts a skill check, or at the start of each round in combat, the victim has a 50% chance to act normally; otherwise, it takes no action. This effect persists for 24 hours but can be ended earlier via a successful <i>break enchantment</i> spell. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Feed (Ex)</strong> As a standard action, Atlach-Nacha can feed upon a helpless or willing living creature by biting it. This deals no hit point damage, but it does cause 2d6 points of Strength drain and 2d6 points of Dexterity drain. If a creature's Strength and Dexterity are drained to 0, any drain that would normally affect those ability scores instead affects Constitution-thus, if Atlach-Nacha feeds on a creature with Strength and Dexterity scores of 0, the Great Old One drains 4d6 points of Constitution instead. A successful DC 43 Fortitude save reduces the drain to the minimum possible. The save DC is Constitution-based.  </p><p><strong>Great Old One Traits</strong> Rules for Atlach-Nacha's Great Old One traits, such as immortality, <i>insanity</i>, its mythic abilities, otherworldly insight, and the base rules for unspeakable presence, can be found on page 306 of <i><i>Pathfinder RPG</i> Bestiary 4</i>.  </p><p><strong>Immortality (Ex)</strong> If Atlach-Nacha is killed, its body splits open and unleashes a hideous mass of swarming spiders. Treat this swarm of spiders as a locust plague swarm (<i><i>Pathfinder RPG</i> Bestiary 5</i> 192) save that it has a base speed of 60 feet, a climb speed of 60 feet, and no fly speed. If this swarm of spiders is allowed to reform after being dispersed by damage (or after 24 hours have passed), the spiders fall upon one another in a cannibalistic frenzy, with the last spider alive growing and growing until it becomes Atlach-Nacha reborn. If the swarm is truly destroyed as a result of devouring a good-aligned minor artifact or holy relic, Atlach- Nacha is instead reborn 1d100 months later from one of countless hidden eggs in deep underground caverns- but typically not on the same world upon which it was most recently defeated.  </p><p><strong>Otherworldly Leap (Ex)</strong> Atlach-Nacha gains a +20 racial bonus on Acrobatics checks made to jump, and this stacks with its bonus to jumping from high speed. It treats all jumps as if it had a running start.  </p><p><strong>Penetrating Bite (Ex)</strong> Atlach-Nacha's bite penetrates all forms of armor. It resolves its bite attacks as if they were touch attacks.  </p><p><strong>Poison (Ex)</strong> Bite-injury; <i>save</i> Fort DC 43; <i>frequency</i> 1/round for 6 rounds; <i>effect</i> permanent paralysis plus 1d6 Strength drain; <i>cure</i> 3 consecutive <i>save</i>s. The save DC is Constitution-based.  </p><p><strong>Powerful Blows (Ex)</strong> Atlach-Nacha always modifies the damage from its physical attacks with 1-1/2 times its Strength modifier.  </p><p><strong>Swift Construction (Ex)</strong> Atlach-Nacha can create bridges or walls from its webs as a swift action. A web bridge is 15 feet wide and has a maximum length of 200 feet. A web wall functions as a <i>wall of stone</i> (CL 20th). Atlach-Nacha can use its climb speed to move on these webs, but other creatures treat it as sticky webbing (see the web universal monster rule on page 305 of <i>Pathfinder RPG</i> Bestiary) if they come in contact with it. Atlach-Nacha's web constructions collapse and melt into vapor after 1 day has passed, forcing the Great Old One to constantly toil to maintain its webs in a futile effort at permanence.  </p><p><strong>Unspeakable Presence (Su)</strong> Failing a DC 35 Will saving throw against Atlach- Nacha's unspeakable presence causes victims to become convinced they are covered with swarming spiders and tangled, sticky webbing. This causes victims to become nauseated for as long as the Great Old One remains in the area plus an additional 1d6 rounds. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Webs (Ex)</strong> Atlach-Nacha can make a ranged attack with its webs as a swift action. These webs have a range increment of 200 feet, and it can shoot up to 10 range increments.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>This strange arachnid Great Old One, known to some as the Void Weaver, is a dualistic entity in many respects. Its gender is fluid, being both and neither male and female.  It constantly toils to build, yet its creations are fated to fail. It exists both in the waking world and the realm of dreams. It embodies the alien form of the spider and the recognizable visage of humanity. To Atlach-Nacha, duality exists only to contradict itself.  Atlach-Nacha is an elephant-sized, red-and-black spider with a monstrously humanoid face, but at times it can appear as a woman with multiple long arms and a spider's lower torso.  <br /><strong>Atlach-Nacha's Cult</strong><br />  Atlach-Nacha's worshipers venerate the spider god in a oddly dualistic way-as both a god of construction and a god of futility. To the Void Weaver's faithful, the act of building is as sacred as the act of deliberately allowing something to fail. Whether this is to create more opportunities for building or more opportunities to fail is irrelevant to these lunatic worshipers, who vacillate daily between the urge to create and the compulsion to give in to entropy and disorder. Atlach-Nacha's temples are often caves or ancient crumbling buildings infested with spiders. The Great Old One grants access to the domains of Artifice, Evil, Madness, and Void and to the subdomains of Construct, Isolation (<i>Pathfinder Campaign Setting</i>: <i>Inner Sea Gods</i> 225), Nightmare, and Toil.

Traditionally, the process of creating a child of Yog-Sothoth involves a blasphemous ritual that uses a mortal creature (typically a human) as an incubator. For the purpose of this ritual, gender is irrelevant. Giving birth to a child of Yog-Sothoth is always fatal. In most cases, the ritual results in the birth of twins-one a child of Yog-Sothoth, which can pass for a time as a member of the race of the creature in which it incubated, and one that cannot. Those twins that inherit a monstrous appearance take more after the Outer God itself in form, and are known as the spawn of Yog-Sothoth (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 4</i> 251).  <br /><strong>Creating a Child of Yog-Sothoth</strong><br />  \"Child of Yog-Sothoth\" is an inherited template that can be added to any living corporeal creature (referred to hereafter as the base creature), but typically, humanoids and animals are those chosen by the cult of Yog-Sothoth to carry the Outer God's gifts. A child of Yog-Sothoth retains all of the base creature's statistics and special abilities, except as listed below.  <br /><strong>Challenge Rating:</strong> Base creature's CR + 1.  <br /><strong>Alignment:</strong> Any chaotic. The vast majority of the children of Yog-Sothoth are chaotic evil. While a good-aligned child of Yog-Sothoth is theoretically possible, such a creature would be significantly unusual in that it would need to have been separated at an early age from the cult that caused its creation, and allowed to mature with the strong guidance of a good-aligned mentor or parental figure.  <br /><strong>Type:</strong> The creature's type changes to aberration (augmented). Do not recalculate its base attack bonus, saves, or skill ranks.  <br /><strong>Senses:</strong> The creature gains all-around vision and low-light vision.  <br /><strong>Armor Class:</strong> A child of Yog-Sothoth has either a +1 natural armor bonus for every 2 Hit Dice it has or the base creature's natural armor bonus, whichever of the two leads to a higher result.  <br /><strong>Hit Dice:</strong> Change the creature's racial Hit Dice to d8s. All Hit Dice derived from class levels remain unchanged.  <br /><strong>Defensive Abilities:</strong> A child of Yog-Sothoth gains cold resistance 10 and fire resistance 10. It has spell resistance equal to its CR + 11, and has a +4 racial bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting effects. A child of Yog- Sothoth is immune to disease and poison.  <br /><strong>Attacks:</strong> While the abdominal tentacles of a child of Yog-Sothoth are merely unsightly sensory organs, the sucker-shaped mouth at the tip of its tail is a primary attack that the child can use as long as it is not concealing  its features (see Special Qualities below). A hit with the tail deals bite damage as normal for a creature of the child's size (1d6 points of damage for a Medium child).  <br /><strong>Special Attacks:</strong> A child of Yog-Sothoth gains the following special attacks.  <br /><i>Blood Drain (Ex)</i>: A child of Yog-Sothoth can drain blood from a grappled or helpless foe via its tail mouth, dealing 1d2 points of Constitution damage per round it does so.  <br /><i>Spell-Like Abilities</i>: A child of Yog-Sothoth gains the following spell-like abilities (the save DCs of these abilities are calculated using the child's Intelligence score as a result of its magic savant special quality, and its caster level equals its Hit Dice): 3/day <i>comprehend languages</i>, <i>detect thoughts</i>, <i>hypnotism</i>; 1/day <i>invisibility</i>; 1/week <i>contact entity I</i>HA. A child of Yog-Sothoth with 5 Hit Dice adds <i>contact entity I</i>IHA to its 1/week spell-like abilities. A child of Yog-Sothoth with 9 Hit Dice adds <i>contact entity I</i>IIHA to its 1/week spell-like abilities. A child of Yog-Sothoth with 13 Hit Dice adds <i>contact entity I</i>VHA to its 1/week spell-like abilities. A child of Yog- Sothoth with 17 Hit Diceadds <i>gate</i> to its 1/week spell-like abilities.  <br /><i>Stench (Su)</i>: A child of Yog-Sothoth always exudes an unpleasant scent. As a swift action, the child can intensify this scent, causing it to become truly nauseating. All living creatures within 30 feet must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 the child's HD + the child's Constitution modifier) or become nauseated for 1 round. The child can exude this nauseating stench for a number of rounds per day equal to its total Hit Dice, but these rounds need not be consecutive. Each round the child wishes to maintain the stench, it must use a swift action to do so. The stench is a poison effect.  <br /><strong>Special Qualities:</strong> A child of Yog-Sothoth gains the following special quality.  <br /><i>Conceal Features</i>: A child of Yog-Sothoth gains a +8 racial bonus on checks to disguise itself as a typical member of the base creature's species (although it always appears as a particularly sizable member of that race) if it takes the time to don clothing or armor to hide its monstrous qualities. When it does so, it loses access to all-around vision and can't make its tail attack.  <br /><i>Magic Savant</i>: A child of Yog-Sothoth's intrinsic understanding of magic allows it to modify the concentration checks and save DCs of its racial spell-like abilities (whether from the base creature or from this template) that are normally affected by Charisma to be modified instead by the child's Intelligence modifier. This doesn't affect actual spellcasting ability, such as that granted by sorcerer levels.  <br /><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> A child of Yog-Sothoth gains the following weakness.  <br /><i>Loathed</i>: Children of Yog-Sothoth are loathed by animals and psychopomps. Both types of creatures gain a +4 bonus on Perception checks and Sense Motive checks against a child of Yog-Sothoth, and receive a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls and weapon damage rolls against such targets.  <br /><strong>Ability Scores:</strong> Str +2, Con +4, Int +4, Cha -2.  <br /><strong>Feats:</strong> A child of Yog-Sothoth gains Toughness as a bonus feat.  <br /><strong>Skills:</strong> A child of Yog-Sothoth gains a +8 racial bonus on Disguise checks to appear as a typical specimen of the base creature when it is using its conceal features ability. All Knowledge skills and Spellcraft are class skills for a child of Yog-Sothoth; a child of Yog-Sothoth gains a +4 racial bonus on Knowledge (arcana) and Spellcraft checks.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Strange_Aeons.jpg","_id":"Fjy62Gb4Zgiw908F"}

A syncytium can activate this ability is a free action. All other creatures in a 30-foot radius must succeed at a DC 18 Will save or be staggered for 1 round. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected by this proto-shoggoth's distracting cacophony again for 24 hours. This is a sonic mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Merge (Ex)</strong> As a full-round action, two proto-shoggoth syncytia can attempt to merge (see the Merge entry in the proto-shoggoth stat block on page 90); each must succeed at a DC 30 Fortitude save in order to merge. If both succeed at this save, they combine to form a fully-grown shoggoth (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</i> 249).</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Early attempts by the elder things (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</i> 4 85) to craft life resulted in strange, heaving masses of protoplasm that displayed a disturbing hunger for living flesh. Emboldened by this discovery, the alien scientists soon stabilized this matter, resulting in the creation of the first proto-shoggoths.  A proto-shoggoth appears as a tangled mass of roiling flesh and organs weighing approximately 160 pounds, and is capable of forming all manner of hideous and nauseating shapes.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Proto-shoggoths have a singularly unusual and disturbing life cycle. While certain vile procedures can result in the artificial creation of a new proto-shoggoth, these creatures can also spawn new proto-shoggoths by infecting the bodies of other living creatures. Yet to grow, a proto-shoggoth does not feed-instead, it seeks out others of its kind to perform a voluntary sort of cannibalism with them, consuming and being consumed, and ultimately combining to manifest a larger version of the whole. Proto-shoggoths thus do not advance in power via the standard rules for increasing a creature's size detailed in Appendix 2 of <i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</i>.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Proto-shoggoths have no true society, and are driven by two overwhelming instincts: the urge to infect living flesh, and the urge to merge with other proto-shoggoths. Once a creature succumbs to such an infestation, a proto-shoggoth instinctually knows to linger in the area and attempts to merge with its freshly born offspring when it erupts from the victim's body. A proto-shoggoth tends not to remain in proximity with others of its kind that it has failed to merge with, but is not hostile toward such incompatible specimens.  Once two proto-shoggoths successfully merge and form a proto-shoggoth syncytium, the syncytium gains a rudimentary intellect that allows it to more successfully seek out others to merge with and finish the growth cycle into a full-fledged shoggoth. It can no longer infect flesh, though, nor can it merge with other non-syncytium proto-shoggoths, but it does understand that lingering in areas where other proto-shoggoths are active will, eventually, give it opportunities to grow. A proto-shoggoth syncytium often acts as a protector over its mindless \"children\" and has been known to use rudimentary cunning to lure (or more often chase) unsuspecting living creatures into proto-shoggoth nests.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Strange_Aeons.jpg","_id":"FtqHfHSp7cdqlY7g"}

Treat this as <i>obscuring mist</i> that fills the area within 10 feet of an oneirogen. A creature 5 feet away in the mist has concealment (attacks have a 20% miss chance). Creatures farther away have total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker cannot use sight to locate the target). An oneirogen cannot suppress this effect, and its vision is impeded the same as that of any other creature. If the fog is blown or burned away, it reforms in 1d4 rounds.  </p><p><strong>Planar Split (Ex)</strong> An oneirogen is trapped between two planes, effectively harboring an active portal within its failing body. Having connections to multiple planes at once, an oneirogen is always affected by spells like <i>dismissal</i> and <i>banishment</i>, which force it to the plane to which its portal connects. Additionally, effects like <i>dimensional anchor</i> cut off an oneirogen's connection to another plane. Such effects suppress the oneirogen's obscuring fog and veil of mists abilities and make the oneirogen staggered.  </p><p><strong>Veil of Mists (Su)</strong> Within the obscuring fog that cloaks an oneirogen lie denser eddies of planar potentiality. This fog is charged with extraplanar energies that manifest in a variety of ways depending on the plane to which  the oneirogen is linked. While an oneirogen is immune to the effects of these vapors, any creature that enters the mists within 5 feet of the oneirogen is affected (see below). These fumes don't impede vision any more than the oneirogen's obscuring fog ability already does. They can also be blown or burnt away (and recover) in the same manner.  Many oneirogens are linked to the Dimension of Dreams-they spew a sour, yellow fog. Creatures that enter this fog must succeed at a DC 12 Will save or fall a<i>sleep</i>. Additionally, they do not receive natural healing from resting for the next 24 hours. The creature can attempt another Will save every round to wake up and can be woken up as if it had been affected by the spell <i>sleep</i>. Creatures that succeed at the save to resist this effect are immune to that oneirogen's veil of mists for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Oneirogens were once normal mortals who suffered a rare but terrible curse. Within them lies a sliver-sized tear between planes, a crack hardly larger than a pinprick that destroys everything they once were in an endless deluge of planar power. Created by magical mistakes and otherworldly conjunctions, oneirogens wander in a haze as living husks whose grip on any reality has been erased. What little remains of their minds is bent on self-preservation, even as they are locked at the center of storms of strange powers endlessly streaming from their mouths and nostrils. The death of their personalities might be a mercy, but what lingers on are primal beings, slaves of uncontrolled planar might.  While the portal trapped within an oneirogen might connect to any plane of existence, it most commonly provides a path to the Dimension of Dreams. As mortal minds already drift toward that realm, breaches between the waking and unconscious worlds might occur when potent magics attempt to tamper with the boundaries of dream. The notorious tome, <i>The Chain of Nights</i>, is just one grimoire known to plumb the depths of thought and nightmare. Those who attempt to use such magic without full mastery, though, risk transforming themselves or those they would aid into drifters trapped between planes.  Some rare, unsettling reports tell of groups of oneirogens collecting in a single place, flooding the surrounding area with planar energies. The effects of such energies on the world surrounding them are unpredictable and usually deadly to native inhabitants.  Oneirogens might arise from any humanoid race, but always appear as mysterious figures cloaked in a strange haze or fog. These creatures rarely live for long, as their bodies swiftly wither from exposure to planar energies, and most lack enough sense of self to bother with eating or other basic needs. Only if protected and tended will an oneirogen live for more than a week.  <strong><br />Variant Oneirogens</strong><br />  Although most oneirogens are living conduits to the Dimension of Dreams, an oneirogen might be linked to almost any plane of existence. While the creatures' statistics are the same regardless of the plane to which they're bound, the effects of the raw planar energy infusing its veil of mists changes. Presented here are variant veils of mists tied to other planes to which an oneirogen might be bound.  <br /><strong>Abaddon:</strong> The oneirogen's portal opens into the Plaguemere, the unholy realm of Apollyon. Creatures that enter the veil of mists must succeed at a DC 12 Fortitude save or be staggered by the noxious smell for 1 round and contract red ache (<i>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</i> 557).  <br /><strong>Abyss:</strong> The oneirogen's portal opens into a vicious Abyssal wilderness of gnashing fangs and nameless, shrieking things. A creature that enters the veil of mists must succeed at a DC 12 Fortitude save or be shaken for 1 round and take a -2 penalty on Will saves for the next 24 hours. The penalty on Will saves ends prematurely if the creature benefits from any effect that grants a morale bonus.  <br /><strong>Elemental Planes:</strong> The oneirogen's portal opens into an expanse of one of the Elemental Planes. Creatures that enter the veil of mists take 1d6 points of energy damage. The type of damage varies depending on the relevant Elemental Plane: acid damage for the Elemental Plane of Earth, cold damage for the Elemental Plane of Water, electricity damage for the Elemental Plane of Air, and fire damage for the Elemental Plane of Fire.  <br /><strong>Elysium:</strong> The oneirogen's portal opens to euphoric haze somewhere in Elysium. Creatures that enter the veil of mists must succeed at a DC 12 Fortitude save or be confused for 1 round. Additionally, the character feels unusually excited or amorous for the rest of the day (no statistical effect).  <br /><strong>Energy Planes:</strong> The oneirogen's portal opens to the overwhelming reaches of either the Positive or Negative Energy Plane. Creatures that enter the veil of mists take 1d6 points of damage of the appropriate type. They take an additional 1d6 points of damage 1 round later, even if they've left the veil of mists, due to the intense energy coursing through their bodies. If the creature is killed by unrestrained positive energy, its body is reduced to a fine ash, making resurrection more challenging. If the creature is killed by unrestrained negative energy, the corpse reanimates as a zombie in 1d4 rounds.  Hell: The oneirogen's portal opens into a terrible inferno somewhere deep in Hell. Creatures that enter the veil of mists take 2d4 points of damage. Half of  this damage is fire damage and half is untyped damage resulting from infernal energy.  <br /><strong>Shadow Plane:</strong> An oneirogen's portal opens to a realm of vaporous darkness within the Shadow Plane. Any creature that comes within 5 feet of the oneirogen is blinded for as long as it remains adjacent to the oneirogen. The oneirogen isn't affected by this effect.  <br /><strong>Wild Portal:</strong> In the rarest cases, one side of an oneirogen's portal is locked within its body, but the other wildly lashes through the planes of existence, connecting to a different reality every round.

Every year, there is a flat 1% chance that such a creature can be targeted by the Great Old One's infected <i>dream</i> ability. If 5 years pass without being targeted, the victim \"forgets\" about Xhamen-Dor until taught of the Great Old One again. A <i>miracle</i> or <i>wish</i> can spell also cause someone to forget in this way.  </p><p><strong>Dread Decay (Su)</strong> A creature damaged by Xhamen-Dor's bite becomes afflicted by a fast-acting infection that swiftly rots flesh and bone into a foul-smelling gangrenous slop. The bitten creature must succeed at a DC 41 Fortitude saving throw or take 2d6 points of Strength drain and 2d6 points of Constitution drain. On a successful save, the victim takes only 2 points of Strength drain and 2 points of Constitution drain. A creature whose Strength score is reduced to 0 by this effect falls comatose and immediately experiences infected dreams (see below). A creature whose Constitution score is reduced to 0 by this effect is immediately absorbed into Xhamen-Dor's body, along with its memories, mind, and soul. Such a creature cannot be restored to life except via <i>wish</i> or <i>miracle</i>. Even then a creature brought back to life in this manner experiences infected dreams (see page 87). This is a disease effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.  </p><p><strong>Entangling Shroud (Su)</strong> Xhamen-Dor is surrounded by a writhing storm of fungal filaments that fills an area equal to his reach. While these filaments are almost microscopic in width, they are quite strong and capable of swatting aside ranged weapon attacks, granting Xhamen-Dor a 50% miss chance against all such attacks. In addition, any creature that ends its turn within Xhamen-Dor's reach must succeed at a DC 37 Reflex saving throw or become entangled as long as it remains in that area. An entangled creature can try to break free as a move action; the DC of the Strength or Escape Artist check is equal to that of the Reflex save to avoid becoming entangled in the first place. The save DC is Strength-based.  </p><p><strong>Great Old One Traits</strong> Rules for Xhamen-Dor's Great Old One traits like immortality, insanity, its mythic abilities, otherworldly insight, and the base rules for unspeakable presence can be found on page 306 of <i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 4</i>.  </p><p><strong>Immortality (Ex)</strong> If Xhamen-Dor is slain, its body collapses into a reeking pile of fungus, hair, and bones. The core of its being compresses down to a tiny blot of incorporeal fungal matter that is immediately expelled from the core of its mass and hurled out into the depths of space. All creatures within 120 feet of Xhamen-Dor when this occurs must succeed at a DC 31 Fortitude saving throw or take 2d6 points of Charisma drain as portions of their sanity and souls are pulled along with the blot. Xhamen- Dor's remains animate as a unique undead creature known as a seeded 24 hours after this event (see page 90 for statistics), but this is merely an echo of the Great Old One. Xhamen-Dor is reborn again when one of two events occur: the blot fired into space impacts a planet, or one of its surviving seeded returns to Carcosa and resurrects as the Great Old One. If the former, it can be centuries or even eons before Xhamen-Dor awakens again, but if the latter, the Great Old One can return within a matter of months or less. The save DC is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Infected Dreams (Su)</strong> Any knowledgeable creature that has succumbed to the yearly 1% chance of Xhamen-Dor's contagious lore ability (see page 86) or whose Strength score has been drained to 0 by dread decay (see page 86) can be targeted by the Great Old One's <i>nightmare</i> spell-like ability, regardless of the distance between the creature and Xhamen-Dor. In order to use infected dreams against a target, Xhamen-Dor must successfully affect that target with its <i>nightmare</i> spell-like ability. If the victim fails its saving throw against the <i>nightmare</i>, it becomes infected with the following virulent fungal blight.  Seeded Infestation-save Fort DC 41; <i>onset</i> immediate; frequency 1/day; effect 1d4 Con drain; cure none. This infestation can be cured only by magic. A creature whose Constitution score is reduced to 0 by this infestation dies and rises in 1d4 rounds as a seeded creature (see page 90). This is an infestation effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.  </p><p><strong>Powerful Tentacles (Su)</strong> Xhamen-Dor's tentacles are treated as primary natural attacks.  </p><p><strong>Unspeakable Presence (Su)</strong> Failing a DC 31 Will saving throw against Xhamen-Dor's unspeakable presence causes a victim to become nauseated for 1d4 rounds, and then sickened for an additional 2d4 rounds. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Spawned countless eons ago within the deepest tainted reservoirs hidden in the foul sewers of Carcosa, the fungal infestation known as Xhamen-Dor, the Inmost Blot, has traveled from world to world for ages untold, infesting reality and returning time and time again to its place of creation to expand the alien city's scope. Full details on  this destructive agency of parasitism can be found on pages 62-67.  Xhamen-Dor is an elephantine mass of fungus and hairlike tendrils capable of assuming any basic form, although its preferred shapes are that of a serpentine creature, a spiderweb-like tangle, or a shuddering carpet of filth.  <br /><strong>Xhamen-Dor's Cult</strong><br />  Xhamen-Dor's cult is unusual in that once it becomes active, it spreads slowly until it reaches a tipping point. Then, its seeded minions quickly overtake entire populations. In most worlds where it is worshiped, its cult is small in number and isolated. Xhamen-Dor's places of worship are found in sewers, graveyards, and other shunned places within civilized realms, but in ruined cities they can expand to encompass multiple buildings. Xhamen-Dor grants access to the domains of Death, Evil, Plant, and Trickery and to the subdomains of Decay, Deception, Murder, and Undead. Its favored weapon is the spear.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Strange_Aeons.jpg","_id":"IvQ4fJn9wbeAi9OW"}

Only 2d6 hours after death, as long as the majority of the creature's body remains relatively intact, a new proto-shoggoth tears itself out of the corpse. This destroys the old body, preventing spells like <i>speak with dead</i> or <i>raise dead</i> from functioning on the remains. A creature slain by an effect such as <i>disintegrate</i> that leaves no body behind can't spawn a proto-shoggoth. Likewise, if an infected body is completely destroyed by fire, acid, or any similar effect, it can't spawn a proto-shoggoth. A body infected with proto-shoggoth material is not contagious-it can't infect other creatures through contact.  </p><p><strong>Infect Flesh (Ex)</strong> When a living creature takes damage from a proto-shoggoth's constrict ability, the monster infects the creature's flesh with its alien enzymes. The victim can resist this infection with a successful DC 23 Fortitude save. Otherwise, the creature becomes sickened as microscopic fragments of proto-shoggoth tissue infest the victim, slowly transforming it from the inside into proto-shoggoth material. In addition to being sickened as  long as the creature remains infected, it must succeed at an additional DC 23 Fortitude save once every 24 hours or it takes 1d4 points of Constitution drain as its body begins to consume itself. This is an infestation effect. An infestation is similar to a disease, but it can be cured only through specific means; no matter how many saving throws a target succeeds at, the infestation continues to affect the target. While <i>remove disease</i> or similar spells can halt the progress of this infected flesh as if it were a disease, immunity to disease offers no protection. Application of negative energy can halt this infestation as well; each time an infected creature is reduced to negative hit points by such an effect, the victim can attempt a new DC 23 Fortitude save. On a success, the infection immediately ends as the negative energy scours the proto-shoggoth material out of the victim's body. The save DC is Constitution-based.  </p><p><strong>Merge (Ex)</strong> As a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity, two proto-shoggoths can merge together in an attempt to fuse. In order to do so, each proto-shoggoth must succeed at a DC 25 Fortitude save-if either fails, both proto-shoggoths become staggered for 1d6 rounds. Those two proto-shoggoths are then incompatible, and can never again attempt to merge with each other, although the individual proto-shoggoths can attempt to do so with other proto-shoggoths in the future. If both proto-shoggoths succeed at the Fortitude save, they immediately merge together and form a Large proto-shoggoth syncytium (see the stat block below).</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Early attempts by the elder things (<i><i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</i> 4</i> 85) to craft life resulted in strange, heaving masses of protoplasm that displayed a disturbing hunger for living flesh. Emboldened by this discovery, the alien scientists soon stabilized this matter, resulting in the creation of the first proto-shoggoths.  A proto-shoggoth appears as a tangled mass of roiling flesh and organs weighing approximately 160 pounds, and is capable of forming all manner of hideous and nauseating shapes.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Proto-shoggoths have a singularly unusual and disturbing life cycle. While certain vile procedures can result in the artificial creation of a new proto-shoggoth, these creatures can also spawn new proto-shoggoths by infecting the bodies of other living creatures. Yet to grow, a proto-shoggoth does not feed-instead, it seeks out others of its kind to perform a voluntary sort of cannibalism with them, consuming and being consumed, and ultimately combining to manifest a larger version of the whole. Proto-shoggoths thus do not advance in power via the standard rules for increasing a creature's size detailed in Appendix 2 of <i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</i>.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Proto-shoggoths have no true society, and are driven by two overwhelming instincts: the urge to infect living flesh, and the urge to merge with other proto-shoggoths. Once a creature succumbs to such an infestation, a proto-shoggoth instinctually knows to linger in the area and attempts to merge with its freshly born offspring when it erupts from the victim's body. A proto-shoggoth tends not to remain in proximity with others of its kind that it has failed to merge with, but is not hostile toward such incompatible specimens.  Once two proto-shoggoths successfully merge and form a proto-shoggoth syncytium, the syncytium gains a rudimentary intellect that allows it to more successfully seek out others to merge with and finish the growth cycle into a full-fledged shoggoth. It can no longer infect flesh, though, nor can it merge with other non-syncytium proto-shoggoths, but it does understand that lingering in areas where other proto-shoggoths are active will, eventually, give it opportunities to grow. A proto-shoggoth syncytium often acts as a protector over its mindless \"children\" and has been known to use rudimentary cunning to lure (or more often chase) unsuspecting living creatures into proto-shoggoth nests.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Strange_Aeons.jpg","_id":"JlriDAfYXk3Ezugw"}

As a full-round action, the husk can become inanimate, during which time it bends light and sounds around itself to disguise its presence. This grants it a +20 bonus on Stealth checks and the benefits of a <i>nondetection</i> spell (CL 20th). The husk can use its spell-like abilities and telepathy while in this state, but any other action causes this effect to end immediately.  </p><p><strong>Dread Decay (Su)</strong> The Husk of Xhamen-Dor's tentacles inflict a horrible affliction that withers the flesh, digesting the victims with sickening speed. This catastrophic withering begins when the tentacle deals damage and continues for 4 rounds thereafter. Each round the rot persists, the target must succeed at a DC 27 Fortitude save or take 2 points of Constitution damage and 2 points of Wisdom damage. If the target succeeds at two consecutive saving throws, the effect is cured. <i>Heal</i> also ends the effect.  </p><p><strong>Latent Great Old One</strong> The Husk of Xhamen-Dor is all that remains of the once-mighty Great Old One Xhamen- Dor. Until it recovers its power completely, it gains all the benefits from all of the Great Old One subtype (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 4</i> 306) save for immortality and mythic.  </p><p><strong>Unspeakable Presence (Su)</strong> Failing a DC 27 Will save against the Husk of Xhamen-Dor's unspeakable presence causes the victim to capitulate to the husk's rotting attacks and become a seeded creature; the victim loses its Dexterity bonus to AC against the husk's attacks. If the creature is also infected with the seedborne consumption-even if it is are otherwise immune to the disease's effects-a failed save also forces that creature to move at least its speed toward the husk each round; once a creature enters the husk's reach, the victim is staggered until the end of its next turn. This ends the compulsion to move closer but not the loss of Dexterity.</p></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Strange_Aeons.jpg","_id":"KUvaHrbALh9bEU9Q"}

He can conceal this symbol within the folds of his robe, and reveal it once again as a move action. Creatures under the effect of a charm or compulsion spell cast by the Pallid Mask take a -4 penalty on their saving throws to resist the effects of the <i>yellow sign</i>.  </p><p><strong>Horrific Revelation (Su)</strong> As a swift action, the Pallid Mask can reveal a horrific truth to a single creature within 60 feet. The target must succeed at a DC 28 Will save or become confused and babble incoherently for 1 round as its mind reels at the terrible revelation. A creature that successfully saves against this ability is immune to this effect for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting, language-dependent effect, and the save DC is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Phantom of Truth (Su)</strong> The Pallid Mask's deceptions transcend truth and reality. He is immune to alignment-based spells and any spell or effect that would force him to tell the truth. Additionally, the Pallid Mask gains Bluff, Diplomacy, and Sense Motive as class skills.  </p><p><strong>Reality Leech (Ex)</strong> The Pallid Mask's touch steals the very essence of reality from his victims. Creatures struck by the Pallid Mask's touch attack take 1d6 points of Charisma drain and become less real, appearing faintly translucent and shadowy. Attacks from such creatures deal half their normal damage, and spells cast by an affected creature that do not deal damage have a 50% chance of affecting their targets. Creatures struck by the Pallid Mask remain unreal for 2d4 rounds. A successful DC 28 Will save negates the Charisma drain and reduces the duration of this effect to 1 round.  A creature whose Charisma score is reduced to 0 by this effect dies and becomes permanently and entirely unreal. The creature functions in all ways as a <i>permanent image</i> (CL 15), and cannot be raised or resurrected until  a <i>wish</i>, <i>limited <i>wish</i></i>, or <i>miracle</i> spell is used to return its physical form. The illusory creature can continue to move and speak, but has no memory of its former life, and cannot travel farther than 30 feet from the place it died.  </p><p><strong>Rejuvenation (Su)</strong> If killed in Carcosa, the Pallid Mask reforms in the parasitic city in 1d4 days.</p></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Strange_Aeons.jpg","_id":"L6TIv1TiWWvfVRWS"}

It is considered blind beyond 60 feet. It is invulnerable to all sight-based attacks and effects, including gaze attacks.  </p><p><strong>Disease (Ex)</strong> A wamp's bite attack infects those it damages with disease. For most wamps, this is a virulent form of zombie rot, but in some cases, a wamp can inflict foes with other undeath-related contagions, such as ghoul fever.  <i>Zombie Rot</i>: Bite-injury; save Fort DC 19; <i>onset</i> 1 round; frequency 12 hours; effect 1d2 Con, this damage cannot be healed while the creature is infected; cure 2 consecutive saves. Any creature that dies while infected rises as a plague zombie in 2d6 hours. The save DC is Constitution-based.  </p><p><strong>Feign Undeath (Ex)</strong> Although the wamp is a living creature, it registers as an undead creature for the purposes of the spell <i>detect undead</i>. As a swift action, a wamp can attempt to trick an undead creature  into thinking the wamp is itself undead-to do so, it attempts a Disguise check opposed by the target undead creature's Perception check. A successful Disguise check allows the wamp to maintain the facade against that undead creature for 24 hours before being forced to make a new check. This ability lets the wamp move relatively unhindered among unintelligent undead, but intelligent undead who understand the threat a wamp presents are unlikely to be fooled by this deception for long. This ability does not allow the wamp to be healed by negative energy; it is harmed by such attacks (and healed by positive energy) as per normal for a living creature. It does grant the wamp a +4 bonus on all saving throws made against attacks and effects generated by undead creatures, regardless of whether its trickery has worked on that particular undead creature.  </p><p><strong>Swift Infection (Su)</strong> All diseases a wamp inflicts on creatures have no <i>onset</i> time, and those who are infected with such a disease must attempt saving throws to avoid its effects twice as frequently as normal for that disease.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Wamps dwell in the dead cities of the Dreamlands, particularly within necropolises or undead-haunted graveyards, where they can hunt their favored prey- unliving creatures with decaying flesh-with ease. A wamp is a vaguely arachnid creature, albeit one with nine legs that end in webbed feet colored a brilliant red, as if the creature had just finished wading through a pool of fresh gore. The wamp's face combines the least attractive features of a pig and a bat, but without the eyes. Covered with bristly pale fur save for their crimson feet, wamps often invite comparison to blood-smeared bones due to their coloration. Wamps often chuckle and chortle as they draw near their prey, eschewing ambush tactics in favor of a more disturbing opening volley of mockery designed to let their victims know that they have been marked for death-yet wamps are not foolish. Against canny foes, wamps can be as silent as the grave before springing to the attack.  A wamp's body is 4 feet in diameter, but its 3-foot-long limbs give it a gangly leg span of 8 feet. It weighs 300 pounds and typically carries with it the faint and unsettling stench of rotting flesh.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  The wamp requires corruption of the flesh, both to survive and to procreate. It cannot digest fresh meat and prefers to feed on carrion it discovers or the flesh of corporeal undead creatures. Most wamps are not averse to slaying living victims they encounter, but they won't feed on the bodies for several days. Instead, they drag the corpses back to their dens to ripen before slurping the spongy, rotting flesh from the bones.  When a wamp feeds on a dead body of at least Small size in this manner, it deposits hundreds of tiny eggs within the flesh, laying them in the decay through the very act of feeding. If a wamp leaves a body mostly unconsumed, these eggs quicken in the festering mess left behind and eventually start to absorb one other. When only one egg remains-having grown into a large mass of pale protoplasmic jelly-it hatches and a newborn wamp emerges. A newly hatched wamp is the size of a watermelon, but it grows quickly and achieves full size in a matter of hours. Once fully grown, a wamp can live for hundreds of years, although most succumb far sooner to violence, for their habits and methods often inspire disgust and retaliation among those they encounter. Fortunately for the enemies of wamps, these creatures are always ravenous and rarely leave behind enough meat on the bones of those they feed upon to spawn offspring.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Despite its alien form, hideous diet, and grim reproductive cycle, the average wamp should not be underestimated, for it is smarter and more curious than the average human. These creatures dwell in dead cities not only because these sites are often infested with delicious undead to feed on and spawn from, but also because such locales often feature a host of old carvings, forgotten libraries, and other cultural relics that can intrigue the mind. The fact that wamps, despite their lack of sight, manage to absorb the ancient lore of their favorite haunts and, over time, become expert historians of the ruins in which they dwell has long baffled scholars, for how could a creature who cannot see read old books or peruse ancient carvings? In truth, the wamp can see the natural decay inherent in all solidity, be it the rot of dead flesh, the erosion that affects carved stone walls, or the different rates of mildewing of paper and ink on printed pages over the passage of eons.  It can be a dangerous but productive pursuit to consult wamps on the lore they have gathered, for they are often eager to divulge the secrets they've learned to visitors, if only as a way to brag about what they've discovered. Curious scholars are advised to keep such sessions with a wamp short, for many find themselves becoming a wamp's eventual meal not long after serving as its audience. Keeping a wamp interested in the conversation may require numerous successful DC 15 Knowledge checks, or perhaps Bluff checks if the converser is seeking only to distract.  It seems that the nature of the particular ruins within which a wamp  dwells might affect how the creature grows in power, as the types of lore left behind on carved stone walls or hidden in forgotten libraries can serve as primary sources of inspiration. Most wamps gain levels as sorcerers, psychics, or even rogues, bards, or clerics (they favor the worship of the Great Old One Tsathoggua), with those who gain the ability to cast arcane spells always seeking the Eschew Materials feat to combat the fact that wamps find it difficult to manipulate material components with their webbed feet. Other wamps simply grow more powerful by increasing in size and Hit Dice-rumors of wamps of up to colossal size persist in some regions.  <br /><strong>Origins</strong><br /> In his novella \"The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath,\" H. P. Lovecraft mentions wamps briefly, describing them as \"web-footed creatures that are spawned in dead cities\" that the ghouls prefer to avoid, while leaving the rest up to the reader's imagination. In Chaosium's Dreamlands expansion to the Call of Cthulhu RPG, they drew upon the writings of Clark Ashton Smith for further inspiration in shaping that game's version of the wamp (in Smith's short story, \"The Abominations of Yondo,\" a strange nine-legged creature makes an appearance but is not called out directly as a wamp). It is upon the Chaosium version that this incarnation of the dreaded wamp is based.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Strange_Aeons.jpg","_id":"P9s9o2KeHOQ7s3JE"}

As a standard action that does not interrupt its performance, a larva can attempt to liberate the flesh of each creature currently affected by its maddening song. Each target must succeed at a DC 25 Fortitude saving throw or be transformed into a chaos beast (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2</i> 54) under the larva's control. A <i>break enchantment</i>, <i>limited <i>wish</i></i>, <i>miracle</i>, or <i>wish</i> spell can return the creature to its original form, though the chaos beast does not willingly submit to such efforts. This is a sonic polymorph effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Maddening Song (Su)</strong> A larva of the Outer Gods can play a song on its pipes that inspires madness in those who hear it. Each creature within 30 feet of the larva is compelled to dance, as per <i>irresistible dance</i>, for as long as the larva continues to play. A creature can attempt a DC 25 Will saving throw to resist the effect, becoming immune to the larva's song for 24 hours. Creatures that fail their saving throws can act normally if removed from the maddening song's area of effect, but they must attempt a new saving throw upon re-entering the song's radius. Beginning a maddening song is a standard action, but a larva can continue the performance on subsequent rounds as a free action. This is a mind-affecting sonic effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Poison (Ex)</strong> Tentacles-injury; <i>save</i> Fort DC 25; <i>frequency</i> 1/round for 6 rounds; <i>effect</i> 1d4 Dex drain and 1d4 Wis drain; <i>cure</i> 2 consecutive <i>save</i>s. The save DC is Constitution-based.  </p><p><strong>Starflight (Su)</strong> A larva of the Outer Gods can survive in the void of outer space. It flies through space at an incredible speed. Although exact travel times vary, a trip within a single solar system should take 3d20 hours, while a trip beyond should take 3d20 days (or more, at the GM's discretion)-provided the larva knows the way to its destination.  </p><p><strong>Void Singer (Su)</strong> The songs of a larva of the Outer Gods travel through the fabric of reality itself. Sonic spells and effects produced by the larva, including its maddening song and liberated flesh abilities, function even in the void of space, in areas of magical silence, and against deaf creatures.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>At the heart of the Dark Tapestry lies Azathoth, a shapeless entity the size of a star, imbued with immense chaotic and destructive power. The members of Azathoth's court orbit it like planets, exalting in the babbling nonsense the blind idiot god issues into the void and singing songs of exquisite madness to their lord. The least of this celestial choir are the larvae of the Outer Gods, shed from Azathoth as a body sheds skin cells. They conjure instruments from the ether, such as pipes and flutes, with which to serenade their progenitor as they mature into gods of the void.  Larvae of the Outer Gods are constantly shifting in form, but average 10 feet in diameter and weigh 1,600 pounds.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Larvae of the Outer Gods are born as minuscule specks of matter sloughed off by the ever-changing bulk of Azathoth. These motes of flesh drift through space, caught in the gravitational gyrations of the idiot god, soaking up cosmic radiation and the songs of their kin. Eventually, the motes grow and coalesce into beings of chaos: larvae of the Outer Gods. Once they are large enough to move of their own volition, the larvae begin to whirl and dance in their orbits around the Primal Chaos, compelled by incomprehensible forces to join the cosmic song and dance.  It is not known where the larvae of the Outer Gods create or steal their instruments. Though strange in appearance, these pipes and flutes are utterly mundane in both function and composition. However, in the hands of the larvae, they become terrible tools of chaos.  When a larva plays an instrument, it does not merely create sounds. Instead, it warps the fabric of space, creating waves in reality. This allows the larvae to serenade their god even in the midst of an absolute vacuum. This dominion over space enables the larvae to conjure creatures from the planes, block dimensional travel, and transport themselves unfathomable distances in an instant.  Though some do eat, most larvae of the Outer Gods subsist on cosmic radiation, allowing them to travel for weeks or months across interstellar voids without dying of hunger or thirst. Over time, exposure to the cosmic winds causes them to swell and mutate, growing even more powerful. The oldest of these larvae eventually mature into colossal beings as powerful as demigods. These beings return to orbit Azathoth and refine their songs. Rumor has it that some eventually reach the next stage of their life cycle, absorbing countless other larvae to become planet-sized gods unto themselves.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Once a larva of the Outer Gods has reached maturity, it is not compelled to stay in the court of Azathoth. Indeed, all have the ability and many have the inclination to explore the Dark Tapestry and the worlds beyond. Larvae of the Outer Gods drift among the stars on unseen currents, or fly through space following songs only they can hear. This often brings them into contact- and conflict-with mortal beings.  Larvae of the Outer Gods bear no ill will toward such creatures, but their presence is often ruinous to mortal forms. Larvae do not understand the concept of mortality, nor can they imagine that a being would not want to be freed from the confinement of a static, unchanging body. Worlds visited by larvae of the Outer Gods thus come to see them as monsters-horrifying emissaries of destruction that spread chaos and fear wherever they roam.  Larvae of the Outer Gods are particularly fascinated by any talented mortal bards and musicians that they encounter, particularly those who are touched by  chaos or the Dark Tapestry. They pursue such players across time and space, much to the musicians' chagrin. These infatuations almost always end with either the larva's destruction, or with the musician succumbing to the larva's song. Some believe that larvae can even transform mortal musicians into fellow larvae of the Outer Gods, and that larvae scour distant worlds seeking to recruit new voices for Azathoth's court.  Foolish mortals sometimes call upon the larvae of the Outer Gods for aid, summoning them to the realms of men in order to strike down some mortal enemy or share the forbidden secrets of Azathoth. While larvae are not opposed to serving such mortals, they also care little for what effect their songs have on mortal flesh. Those who conjure a larva of the Outer Gods are just as likely to fall victim to its maddening song as those they hoped to smite, and those who seek the secrets of the cosmos often learn them at the cost of their corporeal forms. Even when summoners take steps to protect themselves from unwelcome transformations, they find that the larvae of the Outer Gods approach tasks with an unfocused dreaminess that makes them terrible servants.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Strange_Aeons.jpg","_id":"Q2JFUrcXVkYkVtgM"}

This performance relies on audible components.  <i>Symphony of Silence (Su)</i> Zann's music muffles all other sounds within a 30-foot radius. All creatures in the area of effect gain a +5 bonus on all saving throws against sonic attacks or language-dependent effects. Symphony of silence relies on audible components.  </p><p><strong>Dulled Horror (Ex)</strong> Zann gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against confusion, fear, insanity effects, and the supernatural abilities of aberrations.  </p><p><strong>Eldritch Caesura (Su)</strong> Zann can insert unsettling silences into his otherworldly music by spending 1 additional round of bardic performance per round. This supernatural technique impossibly blurs the line between music and light, transmitting audible performances and sonic bard spells through most barriers save lead. This allows the music and sonic spells to affect creatures across planar boundaries (including creatures on the Ethereal Plane or Shadow Plane), vacuums, and areas of magical silence.  </p><p><strong>Mute (Ex)</strong> Erich Zann is unable to speak. Language-dependent effects (including Perform [oratory]) require him to be able to use <i>telepathy</i>, nonverbal languages, or writing to communicate. He can't use Perform (sing) or speak languages, though he can still create audible bardic performances by means of a musical instrument. Zann can provide verbal and somatic components for spells he casts via his violin.</p></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Strange_Aeons.jpg","_id":"TrlDfBj9ugdBbzHf"}

Most  common are humanoid arms and legs in place of the usual limbs, but some of these disgusting creatures have human eyes, ears, or entire heads or faces. Elven ears or dwarven beards appear occasionally, though they are not nearly as common as human traits. There are even tales of goblin-headed beetles roving the Chitterwood of southern Isger in vast packs, singing insane songs as they devour their prey.  Scholars who have had an opportunity to study these creatures up close speculate that they are actually created by some strange form of fungus or parasite that grows a humanlike skin over the existing chitin of the vermin involved. The incredible coincidence of the resemblance to human forms makes the influence of occult magic a strong possibility, but there is no record of the history of these monstrous creatures that might reveal the truth.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Strange_Aeons.jpg","_id":"W2TygfRwCxrN9PNv"}

When invoking a hunting horror in this way, the spellcaster must succeed at a DC 30 Spellcraft check as part of the casting of the spell, or when the hunting horror arrives it is automatically free to act under its own will.  </p><p><strong>Contingency</strong> While the exact details of a particular hunting horror's <i>contingency</i> effect can vary wildly (as the monster has an immense range of potential spells to choose from due to its ability to manipulate magic), most settle for the simple but effective tactic of causing a <i>greater invisibility</i> spell to activate on the hunting horror as soon as it takes damage.  </p><p><strong>Crush (Ex)</strong> A flying hunting horror can land on foes as a standard action, and then use its lengthy coils to crush them. This attack is effective only against creatures three or more size categories smaller than the hunting horror (Medium for most hunting horrors), and affects as many creatures as fit in the hunting horror's space. Any creature in the affected area must succeed at a DC 25 Reflex saving throw or be pinned, automatically taking 4d6+18 points of bludgeoning damage each round it is pinned. If the hunting horror chooses to maintain the pin, it must succeed at a combat maneuver check as normal. The save DC is Constitution-based.  </p><p><strong>Hunter (Ex)</strong> Hunting horrors are efficient and talented at tracking prey, and Survival is a class skill for these creatures as a result. In addition, they gain a +8 racial bonus on Survival checks. When a hunting horror succeeds at a Survival check to follow a creature's tracks, the hunting horror can declare that creature to be its prey. If there are multiple sets of tracks from a group of creatures traveling together, the hunting horror can choose which specific creature becomes its prey if it knows the target is among those in the group; otherwise, its chosen prey is determined randomly. The next time the hunting horror begins a battle against its prey, it gains a +10 bonus on its initiative check. In addition, its prey takes a -2 penalty on all saving throws against the hunting horror's spell-like abilities. A hunting horror can have only one creature as its designated prey at any one time, and if 24 hours pass without the hunting horror succeeding at a Survival check to follow that prey's trail, that creature ceases being the hunting horror's prey.  </p><p><strong>Manipulate Magic (Sp)</strong> A hunting horror is gifted at manipulating magic to affect a wide range of spell-like abilities beyond those that it normally can access. In effect, this allows each hunting horror to use <i>limited wish</i> three times per day as a spell-like ability, but only to duplicate a sorcerer/wizard spell of 6th level or lower. Hunting horrors typically use this ability to deal with foes who manage to stay at a distance, favoring potent attacks like <i>chain lightning</i>, <i>disintegrate</i>, and <i>flesh to stone</i>. Most save the third and final daily use  for emergencies-<i>teleport</i> to escape from a battle gone unpredictably poorly, for example, or <i>break enchantment</i> or <i>greater dispel magic</i> to remove a debilitating effect. All hunting horrors use this ability to maintain a <i>contingency</i> effect on themselves as well.  </p><p><strong>Powerful Tail (Ex)</strong> A hunting horror's tail slap is treated as a primary natural attack.  </p><p><strong>Squeezing Coils (Ex)</strong> A creature that takes damage from a hunting horror's constrict ability after being struck by the hunting horror's tail slap attack must succeed at a DC 29 Fortitude saving throw or fall unconscious for 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Strength-based.  </p><p><strong>Susceptible to Sunlight (Ex)</strong> While the glow of a distant star does not inconvenience a hunting horror, this creature cannot abide the light of a sun in relatively close proximity-including sunlight on a typical habitable planet such as Golarion. When in natural sunlight (but not in an area of <i>daylight</i> or similar spells), a hunting horror can't attack and is staggered. In sunlight, its fast healing ability doesn't function, it loses its damage reduction, and it takes 2d6 points of fire damage per round. In areas of natural sunlight, a hunting horror's light sensitivity increases to light blindness.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Servitors of the Crawling Chaos Nyarlathotep, the serpentine hunting horrors excel at tracking and seeking prey, talents that often see them called on by cultists or spellcasters to hunt down enemies. They speak in great and powerful voices, when they deign to speak at all.  A typical hunting horror is 60 feet long but weighs only 2 tons.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p> A hunting horror abhors light, as it is a creature of inky blackness, some scholars theorize to be akin to the darkness that makes up the Dark Tapestry. Certainly these creatures seem uninterested in obeying the laws of physics in flight; their ability to fly is supernatural, rather than the result of physical exertion- some hunting horrors even have but a single wing that flops lazily as it slithers with great speed through the air. The material that composes their bodies is also supernatural, for although they burn like straw when exposed to sunlight, their hide is thick and difficult to damage with most weapons; only magical blades have a chance of fully penetrating it.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p> Hunting horrors are often called on to perform tasks for wizards or priests, but they are themselves notable scholars of magic. While very few ever bother to become actual spellcasters, their ability to manipulate magic allows them significant variety and alacrity when it comes to generating magical effects. Many hunting horrors take to the creation of magic items, but they are unconcerned with scaling their magical devices for other users, which reduces their utility for smaller creatures. A hunting horror that focuses on item creation generally replaces its Combat Casting feat with Craft Wondrous Item.  <br /><strong>Origins</strong><br /> As with many of the monsters that have come to be associated with the Cthulhu Mythos, like the byakhee, the dark young of Shub-Niggurath, and the gnoph-keh, the hunting horror's original incarnation in fiction was as a vague fragment and a few evocative words. Sandy Petersen ran with these scraps when creating the bestiary section for the Call of Cthulhu RPG, and fully fleshed out the hunting horror into an iconic monster in its own right.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Strange_Aeons.jpg","_id":"WPM41cH8u77u7jgZ"}

Creatures interacting with the projected victim can recognize the illusion with a successful DC 20 Will saving throw. Should the Thrushmoor angler then consume another victim, any subsequent use of its projected victim ability replicates the appearance of this most recent victim. The Thrushmoor angler can communicate through its projected victim with its own language or those known by the represented victim.

All humanoids within 60 feet and with line of sight to the Thrushmoor angler must succeed at a DC 20 Will saving throw or be fascinated and compelled to take no other action than to approach the Thrushmoor angler each round until attacked. A target that succeeds at its saving throw or breaks free of the fascination effect cannot be subject to the same Thrushmoor angler's tantalizing lure for 24 hours. A Thrushmoor angler can suppress or resume this ability as a free action. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>The Thrushmoor angler, named for the Ustalavic town of Thrushmoor around which it can be commonly found, is a bizarre and voracious semiaquatic predator. Preferring to feed on intelligent humanoids, it lurks at the edges of swamps and by marshy riverbanks, using an illusory lure that assumes the form and even the voice of past meals to draw hapless victims into its massive jaws.  At home in deep water and only partially adapted for land, the angler resembles a great, human-sized deep-ocean fish with mottled, slimy skin. The creature's flesh exudes a thick coating of slime, allowing its awkward, bulky body to slide with relative speed through underbrush and along drier surfaces, propelling itself forward by the combined action of multiple powerful but misshapen limbs.  A female Thrushmoor angler is typically 5 feet tall and weighs 250 pounds. Males of the species generally grow no larger than 1 foot in length and weigh less than 30 pounds.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Thrushmoor anglers are not natural creatures, but their true origin remains as murky as the waters they call home. First encountered in the marshes surrounding the Ustalavic city of Thrushmoor in 4683 ar, the creatures have spread further in the decades since. They now primarily dwell within the waters of northern Avalon Bay between Thrushmoor and Illmarsh. The anglers have also moved upstream, colonizing the Danver and Destach rivers, including the latter river's source, Lantern Lake. Despite their expansion, however, the creatures remain most common in and around Thrushmoor itself, and their spread appears oddly self-limited, given that there are ample nearby regions rife for colonization. This suggests that some unknown factor artificially limits the extent of their outward push-a blessing for Ustalav as a whole-or more fiendishly, that something or someone is actively calling out and organizing them, like a shepherd gathering his sheep and not allowing them to run too far afield.  The Thrushmoor angler is most feared for its method of hunting, in which it actively lures prey, not by simply attracting targets to a glimmering light  like some lesser pelagic, piscine predator, but by far more insidious means. Would-be victims report seeing recently lost or missing persons calling out for help, floundering in deep water, or motioning them deeper into swampy overgrowth to retrieve a stuck cow or even to help recover a buried treasure. These visages of the dead are only illusory figments conjured forth by the Thrushmoor angler to draw more victims to where it waits, hidden and with its jaws yawning wide. Once an unfortunate soul steps close enough to the creature, the sight of the iridescent lamp-shaped lure suspended above the angler's misshapen head clouds victim's the mind and draws her to simply walk in a daze toward the angler. The beast prefers to swallow its impassive victims whole, its backward-angled teeth drag them screaming down its gullet.  Commonly thought of as ignorant beasts capable of communication only via their illusory methods of luring in prey, Thrushmoor anglers actually speak a dialect of Aklo. Scholars increasingly posit that the first of their kind were introduced into Ustalav from elsewhere, perhaps flushed into the waters of Lake Encarthan in the waste bilge of ships dumping ballast near port. Others, however, claim the anglers originate from some other plane or planet, or else were created by creatures from such a place, wherever it might be. Such concerns are largely academic, though, to the fisherfolk, trappers, and travelers who most often run afoul of the creatures' appetite for warm and intelligent flesh.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  The description above applies only to female, as this species displays stark sexual dimorphism. By comparison, a male Thrushmoor angler is roughly the size of an adult carp with skin covered in slime rather than scales. They are exclusively aquatic (until attached to a female) and rise only just above animal intelligence. The males have vestigial limbs unfeasible for traveling on land, plus a tiny glowing lure useful only for attracting smaller prey such as minnows, frogs, and small rodents.  Female Thrushmoor anglers prefer to hide themselves in dense brush, thick stands of river reeds, or within marshy shallows just out of easy reach of the shore. Fully amphibious and having lungs as well as the ability to breathe  through their skin when submerged, they return to water only periodically, either to moisten their porous flesh, to digest larger prey, or to spawn. Given the females' protracted periods away from deeper water and their relative rarity, male anglers use a form of sexual parasitism in which they latch onto and literally fuse with their larger partner's body. What at first appear to be a scattered number of atrophied limbs are in fact up to a dozen males grown onto and feeding off of their mate, moving and wriggling as needed to aid in her ambulation and producing much of the slime coat that makes her movement out of water possible.  Lone hunters reliant on ambushes and luring humanoid prey, with half of their species driven by little more than base instinct, Thrushmoor anglers would seem to have relatively little society. Yet the female anglers speak fluent Aklo, and they converse and sing when they undergo their rare spawning periods in deep water. During these times, dozens of their kind gather together and fill the swamps with a dread burble and wail, made all the more eerie by the flickering ghost lights of their deadly lures and not-infrequent invocations to the Great Old One, Bokrug the Water Lizard. Mingling with the anglers' calls and religious cries are the jarring sounds of their illusory lures, as the beasts take pride in showing off their most recent meals and reenacting victims' screaming deaths-displays met by their fellows' hideous laughter.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Strange_Aeons.jpg","_id":"bBsg0iWQ4px6MhGg"}

A clockwork vivisectionist can exit standby as a swift action.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Assembled by unknown creators for inscrutable purposes, clockwork vivisectionists wait in the depths of ageless dungeons or within the tombs of forgotten kings. When wound, they pursue a single purpose: to examine the inner workings of living humanoids. They approach this task with a cold, insatiable curiosity  has somehow been programmed into their clicking levers and complex gear trains. Clockwork vivisectionists enter combat only to paralyze victims for later vivisection.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Clockwork vivisectionists are vaguely humanoid in shape, but they diverge from this general form in disturbing ways. They typically stand 6 feet tall and weigh 250 pounds. They have four segmented mechanical legs that allow them to move quickly in any direction. Their chests are wrought metal cages that swing open to reveal an assortment of syringes loaded with paralyzing poisons, and their misshapen arms end in vicious surgical implements, often caked with dried blood and bits of gore. A clockwork vivisectionist's head has three visages, each facing a different direction, allowing the vivisectionist to see in every direction at once. A vivisectionist's forged metal faces are often locked in expressions of horror, terror, or agony, as if whoever (or whatever) created them was building a facsimile of a humanoid, but had only ever seen faces expressing these emotions. Every few minutes, the faces rotate positions with a ratcheting sound, but it's unclear why a clockwork vivisectionist does this.  The clockwork mechanisms within a vivisectionist are noticeably more complex than those of clockwork constructs built by most sages and engineers in the Inner Sea region. Those few scholars who have examined a disassembled vivisectionist have noted the incredibly precise machining of the gears, the astonishing density of the gear trains, and the banks of levers that seem able to store information by locking into countless combinations of positions. It's possible that the information gleaned from their vivisections is stored within these mechanisms for later retrieval by their mysterious creators. Despite this complexity, clockwork vivisectionists have no true intelligence. The emotionless manner in which they carry out their experiments only amplifies the chilling horror of encountering one.  The key used to wind a clockwork vivisectionist is often difficult to recognize as a key at all. It usually takes an arcane shape and using it may require solving a puzzle of some kind. Examples include a star map cast in bronze that aligns with a star pattern on the clockwork's back (often depicting constellations unrecognizable to denizens of Golarion), a set of independently rotating rings with unfamiliar runes on them that must be inserted into a socket on the clockwork and rotated into the correct alignment, and a complex set of lenses and mirrors that must be correctly focused to shine a beam of light on a particular spot on the clockwork's body.  Because its singular purpose is to cut open and experiment on still-living creatures, a clockwork vivisectionist employs unusual tactics in combat.  Once it has pierced a victim with its scalpel claws and injected him with anesthetic, it drops the paralyzed victim and moves on to another. Only once all enemies are paralyzed or have fled will the vivisectionist begin \"operating,\" keeping each victim paralyzed but alive as long as possible (rarely longer than 1 hour) with regular injections from the bank of fluid-filled syringes in its chest. A victim can continue to attempt DC 16 Fortitude saving throws once per minute to escape the paralysis effect. A victim who escapes or is rescued once this process has begun may suffer from severe mental trauma even after here physical wounds have been healed.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Explorers of the deepest dungeons in Golarion report finding clockwork vivisectionists in isolated chambers surrounded by mutilated corpses that were the result of the vivisectionist's past experiments. This can include entire corpses with the skin removed, organs affixed to walls in careful arrangements, and bizarre sculptures with eerie radial symmetry built from the body parts of multiple victims. Clockwork vivisectionists are often found in areas with connections to Azlant or Thassilon. However, they have also been found in the ruins of Shadun in Qadira, Tumen in Osirion, and in the catacombs of El-Fatar. It is rumored that the Pactmasters of Katapesh maintain a collection of clockwork vivisectionists, their mechanisms wound down and their keys carefully hidden away.  Though they don't typically remain in one location, instead roaming tombs and dungeons in search of victims for as long as their windings will allow, clockwork vivisectionists often seek out traps, natural locations, or other creatures with daze or stun attacks that might help them to conduct their vivisections. Traps involving azure lily pollen (<i>Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Equipment</i> 111), cytillipedes (<i>Pathfinder RPG <i>Bestiary 5</i></i> 65), Leng ghouls (<i>Bestiary 5</i> 120), or tenebrous worms (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2</i> 260) are often found in the same area of a dungeon as a clockwork vivisectionist.  <br /><strong>Construction</strong><br />  No one on Golarion has successfully constructed a clockwork vivisectionist in recent memory, or, if they are indeed the work of extraplanar entities, ever. However, arcane academics who have examined partially destroyed vivisectionists have reverse-engineered the process, and it's rumored that the dwarven metalsmiths of Maheto and arcane researchers in Gurat are competing to be the first to build a functioning one.  Creating these clockworks requires precisely crafted gears and other refined mechanisms, plus various anesthetizing fluids, worth 8,500 gp. However, the process isn't a  matter of simply building the mechanisms in the correct shape-some aspect of a clockwork vivisectionist's function remains incomprehensible and alien to beings on the Material Plane, so aspiring clockwork makers must consult with extraplanar powers using <i>contact other plane</i>. One theory suggests that constructing the clockwork near a gate to Leng, or, for the truly adventurous builder, on Leng itself, may increase the chance of successfully creating a functional clockwork vivisectionist.  <br /></p><div class=\"heading\"><p class=\"alignleft\">Clockwork Vivisectionist</p>  <strong>CL</strong> 10th; <strong>Price</strong> 80,000 gp  <br /><hr /><strong>Construction</strong><hr />  <strong>Requirements</strong> Craft Construct, <i>contact other plane</i>, <i>geas/ quest</i>, <i>limited wish</i>, creator must be at least caster level 10th; <strong>Skill</strong> Craft (clockwork) DC 20; <strong>Cost</strong> 44,250 gp</div></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Strange_Aeons.jpg","_id":"bb5eTrU9sWMaKaEU"}

This ability functions only if the feargaunt and the creature are both in the Dimension of Dreams.  </p><p><strong>Nightmare Aura (Su)</strong> A feargaunt is cloaked in a 60-foot-radius aura of <i>fear</i>, which manifests as darkened shadows, subtle rot, and skewed perspective. The first time a creature ends its turn within the aura, it must succeed at a DC 20 Will save or be shaken for as long as it stays within the aura and for 1d4 rounds thereafter. Creatures within the aura suffering from any <i>fear</i> effects automatically fail Charisma checks to attempt impossible feats. The feargaunt can suppress or reactivate this aura as a swift action. If a target succeeds at its saving throw, it cannot be affected again by the aura for another 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting <i>fear</i> effect.

This bleed damage can be stopped as normal, but also stops when the subject is no longer suffering from a <i>fear</i> effect.</p></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Strange_Aeons.jpg","_id":"c11T4vVhWaHrLbJb"}

In most conditions, it requires a successful DC 30 Perception check to notice the supposed person is actually a construct, although inflicting any kind of wound on the hollow one immediately reveals the truth as the skin covering this creature unravels to reveal an empty cavity within. Hollow ones are complex  creations designed to fulfill a variety of purposes, most often acting as servants, guardians, or assistants. Each hollow one is bound by a physical similarity to a certain humanoid, who sacrifices a portion of himself in the formation process.  Unlike many constructs, however, the hollow one has a spark of intelligent life-the essence of its creator or the creator's victim. While this enlivening energy is little more than a shallow imitation of the original's true being, sometimes the hollow one can become more than an automaton and seek out its own life and motivations. These hollow ones are the most dangerous because they are most prone to madness (especially violent madness). Such a hollow one is the exception to the rule, however, and most are destined to become little more than slaves and playthings, obedient mockeries of those they were created to look like.  When encountered, hollow ones are often mistaken for undead creatures instead of constructs, mainly due to the unconventional building material required to create these creatures.  A hollow one is the same size as the humanoid it was fashion to resemble, but weighs a mere fraction of his weight due to being only chemically treated skin.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  As constructs generally created by alchemists, hollow ones are uncanny replicas of humanoids made from shreds of skin infused with magic and rare chemicals. Hollow ones have an advantage over many constructs in that they have intellects gifted to them by their creators during their construction. Even those who know the humanoids on which hollow ones are modeled well may still be duped by the hollow ones, as they are fashioned by a process similar to that used to create simulacra and their true nature is difficult to discern.  The fundamental intelligence of these creatures makes them dangerous, however. They are unstable beings, and 5% of hollow ones harbor a deep loathing and jealousy of their creator, to a point where they cannot abide continuing to serve them. These hollow ones turn on their owners, seeking to kill and sometimes replace them. Another 5% of hollow ones develop a greater intelligence and personality than the creatures on which they're modeled, becoming superior versions of the originals. Often seeking the immediate destruction of their would-be masters, these hollow ones have inflated views of their own importance and place in the world and proceed to try to convince others of it. These creatures gain a +4 bonus to both Intelligence and Wisdom and a +6 bonus to Charisma. Many of these hollow ones go on to take class levels, typically matching those of their creator (or the person being emulated).  Hollow ones begin as blank slates in terms of development. The energizing force within each evolves  differently, so that three hollow ones created at more or less the same time by the same master can result in three unique constructs depending on the context and situational factors in which they were created.  Some scholars make the assumption that the first hollow ones were created by foul creatures that made use of fleshwarping, but little evidence for this has been found. Records retrieved from before Earthfall mention hollow ones, so the practice of making these bizarre constructs is more than 10,000 years old, though it has only recently come to light again in Avistan.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Many hollow ones take on specific aspects of their creators. Some arcane psychologists and philosophers have suggested that the inherited aspect is the creator's most overriding emotion or state of mind at the time. Thus, a happy creator fashions a jolly hollow one, while a psychotic person creates a deranged one, and so on. However, the hollow one nurtures this aspect into something larger as it develops. Misery becomes overwhelming sorrow or joy becomes completely unbearable. Each year after its creation, the construct must succeed at a DC 25 Will save or lapse into madness brought on by these emotions. The direction this madness takes varies, but is always dangerous in some way.  Hollow ones develop their own mannerisms similar to-but not always identical to-their creators'. Those that escape into society often act as beacons for other constructs-paragons and leaders that use their constructed followers on crusades of their own twisted devising, taking on levels in various classes, and become tyrants, dictators, and saints in their own design.  Several narcissistic cabals and cults use hollow ones as tools of vengeance and assassination, creating scores of copies of the cult leader to visit punishments upon dozens of enemies at the same time, creating the illusion of omnipotence. Such tactics have been employed by power-crazed tyrannical alchemists, who go on a frenzy of self-harm and create scores of hollow ones. Sadly, such personal killers often become so crazed that they turn on their creator en masse and exact suitable revenge, usually starting by flaying the creator alive.  A tale circulating through Absalom speaks  of a thieves' guild that once operated in that city and employed hollow ones as patsies and for blackmail. The guild leadership would capture someone, torture the captive by flaying her skin, and then healing her so there was no evidence of the stolen tissue. They would then send the hollow one to commit a visible crime in order to implicate their victim. To clear her name, the victim was forced to pay the guild's leadership a hefty price.  <br /><strong>Other Hollow Ones</strong><br /> The method for creating hollow ones don't restrict the form to be that of a humanoid. The form needs to be a creature that has skin, though. A catalog of constructs was recently unearthed from an old Azlanti ruin that described an aboleth hollow one that perplexed the ancient explorer who encountered the strange creature. Hollow ones made in the form of creatures with particularly durable skin could have a much higher natural armor bonus than the typical hollow one described here.  <br /><strong>Creating a Hollow One</strong><br /> The process used to fashion a hollow one requires the creator to collect a considerable quantity of the skin of the person being copied (referred to as the subject) using knives and an arcane ritual that ultimately deals 1d4 points of Constitution damage to the subject. The skin is alchemically treated and enhanced into a form not unlike the wrappings of a mummy. At the final moment of the ritual, the creator removes a piece of the subject's brain using a specially created brass and ebony hook with a tiny movable cutting blade attached. This hook is inserted into the subject's brain through the nose to remove a portion of living brain tissue, an act that deals an additional 1d2 points of Constitution damage to the subject. At this point, the creator must succeed at a DC 30 Heal check; otherwise the subject permanently loses 1d3 points of Intelligence.  <br /></p><div class=\"heading\"><p class=\"alignleft\">Hollow One</p>  <strong>CL</strong> 9th; <strong>Price</strong> 42,000 gp  <br /><hr /><strong>Construction</strong><br /><hr />  <strong>Requirements</strong> Craft Construct, <i>lesser simulacrum</i>UM; 2 square yards of skin collected over the course of 1 month and 1 ounce of brain material; creator must be caster level 9th; <strong>Skill</strong>s Craft (alchemy) DC 24 and Heal DC 24; <strong>Cost</strong> 21,000 gp</div></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Strange_Aeons.jpg","_id":"f2q5Vqbe9B2lCOt7"}

The two best known are their mindlessness (a feature that lets an experienced adventurer manipulate the ooze in a battle, due to its inability to use tactics) and their lack of armor (a quality that allows for tactics like Power Attack to be used with abandon). However, those who stumble across one of the so-called formless spawn of Tsathoggua would do well to remember that not all oozes are mindless and easily hit in combat, for these deadly guardians prove quite cunning and display an alacrity that grants them incredible defenses against physical attacks.  A formless spawn at rest resembles nothing more than a simple puddle of tar, oil, or another dark, thick liquid; once roused to attack, however, it could never be mistaken for anything other than a monstrous and malignant predator. The creature's outline changes constantly, shifting from serpentine to insectile to a truly shapeless mass-at times even approximating humanoid or other bestial shapes before collapsing in on itself a moment later. Always, the formless spawn sends forth a storm of tendrils that whip and writhe, blocking attacks and fouling attempts at combat maneuvers. The creatures can speak if they deign to, yet they rarely bother to do so with creatures that have fixed shapes-formless spawn consider talking to one's food a waste of time.  A formless spawn is elephantine in size, capable of covering a 15-foot-diameter pool to a depth of a foot, and it weighs just over 9,000 pounds. Even at this weight, a formless spawn is only about as dense as oil and thus floats on water, unless it actively swims down under the surface.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  A formless spawn is a sentient and quite intelligent mass of protoplasm capable of assuming any basic shape but incapable of holding that form for long. It has no true shape. The ooze's characteristic formlessness results from a combination of physical disinclination to stay in one configuration (doing so causes a formless spawn something akin to nausea) and a mental inability to even comprehend the concept of a fixed form. Still, a formless spawn hardly seems to suffer at all in power or intellect for these constant fluctuations in appearance. Indeed, they often ridicule those who they view as being \"locked\" into a single shape, although most creatures never even get the chance to hear such mockery, for formless spawn are  usually more eager to slaughter and consume those they encounter than speak to them.  Formless spawn do not age-a process that spawn refer to as \"a crude biological function\"-nor do they reproduce. All formless spawn that exist were themselves spawned from sources deep below the ground. The original formless spawn issued fully formed and aware from Tsathoggua himself, but after a time, the very rocks in places where that Great Old One slumbered seemed to gain the ability to create them. Just as pockets of oil might bubble up from a fissure in the stones, so too might a fully formed spawn come into being. Fortunately, such points are few and far between. While spawn do not grow old or mate, they must eat, and a spawn denied meals can starve to death. When a spawn uses its freeze ability, its metabolism slows significantly-a spawn masquerading as a pool can live for decades or even centuries without eating, but upon awakening, it is always ravenous and must seek sustenance promptly or begin to starve.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  The majority of formless spawn that are encountered are acting as temple guardians or agents of the cult of Tsathoggua, to the extent that many texts refer to these monsters by a longer name: the formless spawn of Tsathoggua. Within the Great Old One's temples, a formless spawn often resides within a large font or other carved container that upon first glance might appear to be little more than a decorative aspect of the shrine. Those formless spawn that are encountered in the wild are almost always ones that have lost their temples or have survived the destruction of a cult they once served. Formless spawn wander the deep tunnels of the Darklands relentlessly, driven by an urge to seek out new cults or temples of their father to serve. These formless spawn, subjected to a wider range of obstacles and challenges, most often advance beyond the standard powers presented above, either by gaining Hit Dice or class levels. Formless spawn that gain levels generally do so as clerics of Tsathoggua, psychics, rogues, or sorcerers. A spellcasting formless spawn usually takes Eschew Materials as a feat as early as possible, but as long as it  worships Tsathoggua, it can use its own body as a divine focus in place of a holy symbol when casting spells.  In some cases, formless spawn manage to ascend beyond being mere guardians of a temple or agents of a cult, and wind up actually leading the temple itself. These formless spawn are almost always clerics of Tsathoggua, and they often count several standard spawn among their servitors, alongside the various humanoid or monstrous cultists who make up the bulk of the clergy. Legends of formless spawn being able to hold a single shape for extended periods of time are inaccurate, and they are often confused with accounts of shoggoths that have developed this capability. Despite both being dark-colored oozes, shoggoths and formless spawn have very little in common-the former being regarded by the latter as dangerous but useful beasts of burden, and with the shoggoths themselves generally showing minimal interest in anything other than themselves.  <br /><strong>Origins</strong><br /> This memorable creature first made its appearance as an unnamed antagonist in Clark Ashton Smith's short story, \"The Tale of Satampra Zeiros,\" wherein a pair of would-be thieves run afoul of the monster in a lost jungle city while searching for treasure said to be held within a temple devoted to Tsathoggua.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Strange_Aeons.jpg","_id":"f52ooblJiaTxnQ9k"}

If the save is successful, the victim takes 2d6+8 points of damage and is wracked by pain for 1 round, gaining the staggered condition. It is thereafter immune to that hooded harbinger's bloodless touch for 1 day. On a failed save, the portion of the victim's body that is touched begins to swell and turn purplish-black as the blood flow to it is restricted. This effect deals 4d6+12 points of damage per round and the victim gains the staggered and sickened conditions from the intense pain. After 1d4 rounds, the victim can attempt a new saving throw each round to try and end the effect. The effect can be ended sooner by a heal spell or a successful DC 23 Heal check. The Heal check requires a precise incision to the affected flesh, and consequently deals 2d6 points of bleed damage to the victim as the pressure of the entrapped blood flow is released. Once a victim has been affected by a bloodless touch, it can't be affected by another until the effects of the first one have ended. If the effects are ended by a successful save, then that individual is immune to further bloodless touch attacks by that hooded harbinger for 1 day. The bloodless touch attack of a hooded harbinger affects only living creatures with recognizable physiology and a blood supply. Undead, oozes, most constructs, and creatures that are not subject to precision damage are immune to bloodless touch. The save DC is Constitution-based.  </p><p><strong>Manifest Yellow Sign (Sp)</strong> Once per day, a hooded harbinger can trace a mystical pattern in the air, causing a glowing, immaterial image of the Yellow Sign to appear before it. This image remains in place for 1d4 minutes. Any creatures within 100 feet who is able to see the sign (it glows as per light) must succeed at a DC 23 Will save or be confused for as long as the sign persists. The sign can be <i>erase</i>d with <i>dispel chaos</i>, <i>dispel evil</i>, <i>dispel magic</i>, or <i>erase</i> with a successful DC 26 caster level check. Anyone under the effects of the Yellow Sign will not act against the hooded harbinger in any way, though that does not mean that they will follow its commands. The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +2 racial bonus. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect.  </p><p><strong>Profane Reek (Su)</strong> The musty, carrion stench wafting from the foul folds of a hooded harbinger's rags extends in a 5-foot radius, creating an aura of obscene influence around the creature. This terrible smell gives a hooded harbinger a profane bonus to its AC equal to its Charisma modifier. In addition, any breathing creature that enters this cloud must succeed at a DC 21 Fortitude save or be affected as though under the mental effects of a <i>mind fog</i> spell for as long as it remains within the profane reek's area of effect and for 2d4 rounds after it leaves. A creature that succeeds at its save is immune to the <i>mind fog</i> effect of that hooded harbinger's profane reek for 1 day. The save DC is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Prophetic Utterance (Su)</strong> Three times per day as an immediate action, a hooded harbinger can mutter a prophetic utterance against any single creature within 100 feet that has just dealt damage to it. This mutter is unintelligible to anyone but the target, which hears the utterance as a telepathic message pronouncing its <i>doom</i>. The target is immediately affected by a <i>doom</i> spell (no save) for the next hour or until the utterance is successfully dispelled (requiring a successful DC 26 caster level check).  </p><p><strong>Terrible Visage (Su)</strong> A hooded harbinger never reveals its face. Only if slain or rendered helpless can anyone attempt to remove the hood and reveal the harbinger's true visage. However, as layers of the stinking, rotten wrappings around its face are peeled back or cut away, new layers are found beneath. These many filth-crusted layers can be removed only with 1d4+2 rounds of effort. If they are successfully removed, only those adjacent to the creature can see the revealed countenance and anyone able to do so must succeed at a DC 21 Will save or be affected by an <i>insanity</i> spell. Those who succeed at their saves are unaffected, as their minds mercifully <i>erase</i> the image from their memories. Those cured of the <i>insanity</i> receive the same relief. Immediately after the hooded harbinger's face is revealed, its body explodes in a massive flash of light and concussive force that completely obliterates all evidence of it. Anyone within 10 feet of the corpse when it explodes takes 6d10 points of force damage (Reflex DC 23 half) and must attempt two DC 23 Fortitude saves, one against blindness and one against deafness (both as per blindness/deafness). The save DC to resist the <i>insanity</i> effect is Charisma-based, and the save DCs to resist the explosion's effects are Constitution-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>It is said that the Crawling Chaos is the messenger of the Great Old Ones, but whether this is by their command or his own whim is debatable. Regardless of why, the Great Old One known as Hastur sometimes instead relies on his hooded harbingers to relay messages to his far-flung cults and even to the High Priest Not To Be Described of mystery-shrouded Leng. These dread figures swathed in filthy yellow rags bear the whispered tidings of their Unnamed Lord. There are those who even speculate that the veiled priest of Leng is actually the greatest of the hooded harbingers, who gained some measure of autonomy-but the truth of this remains unknown. Thought to have originated in distant Carcosa by unthinkable means, hooded harbingers are exceedingly rare, and seldom is more than one encountered at a time.  Though tasked with the menial role of messengers, hooded harbingers take their charge very seriously. Infused with the hateful potency of their master, they are able to call  upon many terrible powers in defense of their duties. When forced into combat, they prefer to trip opponents with the trailing ends of their ragged arm coverings and administer their bloodless touch to as many victims as possible. They always attempt to use <i>plane shift</i> to flee if in danger of imminent defeat.  Serving as messengers for Hastur, hooded harbingers receive the communications they deliver directly from the Great Old One via mental transmission. Upon receiving the message, the hooded harbinger twitches and shakes as if it were having a seizure. During this time they are particularly dangerous, because if they are attacked or distracted in any way, they fly into a furious rage and the offender risks attracting the attention of the King in Yellow.  No one has seen a hooded harbinger's face and lived to describe it. If its hood is pulled back, the creature's head is seen to be completely swathed in the same filthy rags that cover its body. If it is helpless, the rags can be unraveled, but each layer only gives way to dozens of layers of the tattered yellow cloth. Eventually, a face is revealed, but it appears to be the face of the unraveler. If she is lucky, her memories are immediately wiped clean. If she is less fortunate or less able to forget, she is driven insane.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Strange_Aeons.jpg","_id":"hFv299nYLErE99zF"}

For 1 minute after it bites a target, it gains a +2 morale bonus on attack and damage rolls against that target. A byakhee has no limit as to how many simultaneous bloodlust targets it can have at any one time, but it generally focuses on the same target once its bloodlust is engaged. It also gains these bonuses on attack and damage rolls against creatures taking bleed damage from any source.  </p><p><strong>Low Metabolism (Ex)</strong> While a byakhee craves blood if it hasn't fed within the last 24 hours, it doesn't suffer any negative effects from starvation, and it can, in theory, survive forever without drinking or feeding. It is immune to effects that induce magical starvation or thirst, yet it still seeks to drink blood whenever it can to sate its desire. Its strange metabolism and body also render it immune to critical hits, sneak attacks, and other forms of precision damage.  </p><p><strong>Starflight (Su)</strong> A byakhee can survive in the void of outer space, and it flies through space at incredible speeds. Although exact travel times vary, a trip within a single  solar system normally takes it 3d20 months, while a trip beyond normally takes it 3d20 years (or more, at the GM's discretion)-provided the byakhee knows the way to its destination.  </p><p><strong><i>Yellow Sign</i> Affinity (Ex)</strong> A byakhee is immune to the effects of the <i>Yellow Sign</i>, and by concentrating, it can locate the nearest active <i>Yellow Sign</i> as per <i>discern location</i> (CL 20th). When an active <i>Yellow Sign</i> is visible, a byakhee gains fast healing 2 and a +4 enhancement bonus to its Dexterity. An active <i>Yellow Sign</i> is either one that was created by Hastur or by the <i>Yellow Sign</i> spell (see page 72). Inactive <i>Yellow Sign</i>s, such as the unholy symbols carried by cultists of Hastur, do not bolster a byakhee, but these creatures generally treat those who openly wear such symbols as allies. A character who displays a <i>Yellow Sign</i> in this manner gains a +5 circumstance bonus on all Bluff, Diplomacy, and Intimidate checks against a byakhee.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Byakhees are a race of interstellar aberrations that hail from the distant and alien city of Carcosa, where they serve Hastur. Vaguely humanoid in shape, their bodies combine elements of the forms of carrion birds, insects, and mammals, giving an outward appearance that, while horrific, might at first glance seem possible in the natural world. Yet, those who have studied dead byakhees know this to be a lie, for the creatures' bodies hold bizarre organs and masses of unknown tissue that seem to serve no purpose; the further into a byakhee's body one explores, the stranger its entrails become. The fact that portions of its body appear to be decaying or rotting away even as it lives only adds to the mystery of the creature's peculiar anatomy.  A byakhee is 6 feet tall and weighs 160 pounds.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Scholars have long argued that byakhees' somewhat humanoid shape suggests a relationship to a less aberrant form of life, and that these creatures may once have even been humans. Indeed, byakhees were created from the original human denizens of the ancient city of Alar. When that city declared war upon its neighbor Carcosa, Alar vanished without a trace on the next rising of its planet's red sun. In truth, the city and its citizens did not disappear-they were absorbed and transformed by Carcosa. Alar's inhabitants became the first byakhees, and ever since, their kind has unwaveringly served the lord of Carcosa, the King in Yellow.  Although a byakhee longs to consume the blood of the living, it doesn't actually ever suffer the effects of thirst or starvation and can live its entire life without ever tasting a drop of blood. Nonetheless, these creatures still feel something akin to hunger-albeit a sensation driven by a mental impulse other than a biological imperative. Some scholars theorize that this  hunger is nothing more than a remnant from the race's past, a sort of ancestral memory of starvation, perhaps, that drives them to drink blood out of a psychological need rather than a physical one. Certainly, byakhees' bloodlust is a powerful driving force; once a byakhee has bitten a foe, it has difficulty thinking of anything other than latching on and drinking its victim dry.  Byakhees' ability to fly between worlds through the depths of space is shared by several other types of creatures, many of which are tied in similar ways to the Elder Mythos. They are often called upon by spellcasters who use rare or forbidden magic to take advantage of such transport, yet unlike shantaks (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2</i> 244), who can impart some of their defenses against the depths of space to those they carry through the gulfs between worlds, byakhees can offer no such protection. The creatures delight in carrying ignorant spellcasters into the cold, airless void when foolishly commanded, as they feel no need to warn their would-be passengers of the dangers of interstellar travel.  A byakhee can live for centuries, although most perish from violence before attaining such an age.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Byakhees serve Hastur, his cult, and the city of Carcosa, driven by an ancient compulsion that is still as much a part of what they are as their claws and wings. The rare byakhees that manage to ignore this urge in order to serve another master-or even more remarkably, to obey no master at all-are particularly hated by other byakhees, and no efforts are spared in the pursuit of such enemies of Carcosa when their existence is exposed.  Priests of Hastur can conjure byakhees with the proper magic, as can spellcasters who use rare and eldritch spells (such as <i>contact entity I</i>, found on page 113 of <i>Pathfinder RPG Horror Adventures</i>, which uses a silver whistle as the material component). Once called to a new world to serve the cult of the King in Yellow, byakhees are quick to establish a colony. Young are hatched from noxious, leathery eggs and grow to maturity over the course of only a few weeks. Yet, once a local byakhee population reaches a few dozen, they lose the drive to procreate entirely. Only in rare cases, such as within the streets of the alien city of Carcosa or on worlds that have fallen fully under Hastur's control, are byakhees encountered in significantly larger numbers.  Despite their bestial appearance, byakhees are as smart as the typical human and much wiser and charismatic than most. As such, it isn't uncommon for leaders among their kind to grow in power by gaining class levels. Byakhees can excel in most  classes, although they tend to avoid taking levels in classes that grant companions, mounts, or familiars- they find the presence of creatures from the natural world unpleasant at best. Most byakhees that take class levels do so as barbarians, clerics of Hastur, psychics, or sorcerers with the aberrant or starsoul bloodlines (<i>Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide</i> 140).  <strong><br />Origins</strong><br /> The byakhee has been a staple of Lovecraftian RPGs in large part due to their inclusion in Chaosium's Call of Cthulhu Roleplaying Game, and it is Sandy Petersen's take on byakhees that largely inspired their Pathfinder incarnation. The creatures first appeared in print in August Derleth's short story, \"The House on Curwen Street.\" They never actually appeared in any of Lovecraft's writings, although Chaosium has taken the description of the nameless creatures from Lovecraft's short story \"The Festival\" as the basis for the monster's strange appearance.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Strange_Aeons.jpg","_id":"ii3fcATbnNSqctfE"}

Like many of their common jellyfish cousins, the creatures in a swimming eye swarm are incredibly poisonous. Their uncanny eyeballs act as poison sacs as well as a sensory organ. These eyes are remarkably fragile, often bursting after even the gentlest jostling. However, a swarm's eyeballs grow back quickly, often in less than a week.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Strange_Aeons.jpg","_id":"iuQ4OD3bzdjhxlNd"}

A creature that fails its saving throw against this aura takes a -1 penalty on attack rolls and on saving throws against fear effects while within the aura and for 7 minutes after leaving the affected area. Any creature that successfully saves against this power cannot be affected again by it for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting fear effect, and the save DC is Charisma-based. A creature within range of a keeper's disquieting aura can be affected by its <i>bestow curse</i> spell-like ability from a distance (not only by touch). If a target of the aura has seen the Yellow Sign, it takes a -2 penalty on its saving throws against the aura and the keeper's <i>bestow curse</i> spell-like ability.  </p><p><strong>Entropic</strong> </p><p><strong>Drain (Ex)</strong> A keeper's use of its energy draining ability can result in a surge of entropy that consumes its body and disrupts life all around it. Every time the keeper's entropic drain attack results in a creature's death, the keeper must succeed at a DC 17 Fortitude saving throw or be destroyed. If the keeper is destroyed, all sentient beings in a 15-foot radius around the keeper gain a negative level (Fortitude DC 17 negates). If any negative level bestowed by a keeper becomes permanent, the victim must succeed at a DC 17 Will saving throw or die after 1 hour of delirium. The save DCs are Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Sunlight Powerlessness (Ex)</strong> A keeper of the Yellow Sign is powerless in natural sunlight (though not in an area of <i>daylight</i> or similar spells), and it cannot attack and is staggered. It can use its supernatural and spell-like abilities, but with a 50% failure chance.  </p><p><strong>Yellow Sign Affinity (Su)</strong> When the keeper of the Yellow Sign stays within 1 mile of an active <i>Yellow Sign</i> for 24 hours, it gains a +2 profane bonus to its Armor Class and a +1 resistance bonus on all saving throws. An active Yellow Sign is either one that was created by Hastur or by the <i>Yellow Sign</i> spell (see page 72). If the keeper leaves this range, it loses the bonuses immediately and can regain them only after once more staying within 1 mile of an active <i>Yellow Sign</i> for 24 hours.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>A keeper of the Yellow Sign is the undead form of a cultist of Hastur who willingly sacrificed his soul to rise as his god's servant after death. A quiet but relentless champion of the Unspeakable One, a keeper brings anxiety and woe to the lives of any infidel who comes too close to the secrets of its master. Like a vampire, a keeper can easily pass for a living human, if it so wishes, although it tends to have a pale, unhealthy look and a swollen face that can give away its true nature to those who know what to look for. Feeble and sluggish in the sunlight, a keeper can easily be mistaken for a sickly vagrant or even a leper if seen in the open during the day. In the <i>darkness</i>, however, a keeper grows supernaturally strong and attentive, and its eyes glow with a malignant, yellow luminescence.  A keeper's primary purpose is to haunt and persecute unbelievers who witness the Yellow Sign or, worse, have a document or item that bears the dreaded symbol, such as a copy of <i>The King in Yellow</i> or another artifact of Hastur's cult. Against these favored victims, the keeper uses <i>dream</i> to create a sense of anticipation and awareness of its victim's forthcoming doom. Although a keeper's actions are mainly motivated by a sadistic eagerness to spread pain and misery, the creature can also perform special duties on behalf of a cleric of Hastur, such as slaying her personal enemies or harassing cultists she considers unworthy. These monsters also have an odd, morbid attraction for art in all its forms, favoring bizarre  and decadent creations. Since a keeper's energy drain ability can cause its own destruction, one interested in prolonging its own existence uses its touch attack sparingly. Typically, a keeper switches to touch attacks when it faces heavily armored adversaries otherwise difficult to hit, when it is reduced to half hit points (and therefore already facing destruction), or when it simply feels the urge to \"taste\" the energy of a victim, usually one with artistic talent (such as anyone who demonstrates particular skill in the areas of Craft or Perform).  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  As undead creatures, keepers of the Yellow Sign do not reproduce, though their existence in a given area can signify the presence of a cult of Hastur. Interacting with such creatures can sometimes influence other followers of the King in Yellow to undergo the transformation ritual and become keepers themselves. Keepers do little to proselytize and do not seek out potential converts to their faith or possible additions to their ranks. Rather, they are singularly focused on preventing evidence or knowledge of Hastur's cult from spreading to unbelievers, pursuing anyone who has seen the Yellow Sign, has an artifact bearing the powerful symbol, or has intimate knowledge of a cult's activities or plans.  A keeper of the Yellow Sign does not need to eat, drink, or breathe, but it nevertheless has an urge to consume the energy of those who show particular talent in the arts. When using its energy draining abilities to sate such a hunger, the keeper typically drops its normally dour demeanor in favor of one of ecstasy and satisfaction, a small hint at Hastur's predilection for decadence and depravity. The keeper generally regains its composure immediately after it is done draining its victim's energy, though in rare cases a keeper might become so enraptured by the experience that it does not stop before its victim dies, thus putting itself in danger of self-destructing as the essence of life drained from its victim overwhelms it.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  A keeper of the Yellow Sign can be found anywhere there are active cults of Hastur or in ruins where a cult once existed, especially those locations marked by a Yellow Sign. Keepers rarely travel far from the site of their creation, preferring to live  reclusive, solitary existences in nearby communities. They seldom congregate with others of their kind, except when multiple keepers serve the same priest of Hastur. The undead retain their memories of life, and those rare independent keepers that share the company of other keepers often knew one another in life-likely they came from the same cult of the Unspeakable One and took part in the same transformation ritual. Despite this connection, however, even paired keepers yearn to be alone with their despair and insanity-wracked thoughts, coming together only for protection from outside threats or to overpower potential targets that are more powerful than a lone keeper could handle.  In the communities where they reside, keepers are often mistaken for vagrants, mendicants, and diseased beggars. They often sit on unoccupied stoops, on public benches, or in gutters, muttering to themselves for hours on end, all the while watching passersby for indications that their neighbors may have witnessed the Yellow Sign. When offered charitable help by kind souls who encounter them, keepers of the Yellow Sign typically flee rather than risk giving away their true nature, which leads to the common belief that they are simply mad and either unwilling to receive aid or incapable of accepting it. Other times, they take on jobs that the general populace deems unsavory or macabre, such as gravedigger or hearse driver. They can observe potential targets from afar in these roles, lurking in cemeteries or churchyards and turning their unnerving gazes on the targets of their ire.  By remaining on the fringes of society, however, a keeper of the Yellow Sign can exist unheeded in a single settlement or region for generations, as most residents pay so little attention to it that they fail to notice that the creature never ages or dies. As such, some keepers are old enough to remember past millennia-yet, they are rarely sane enough or willing enough to recount their knowledge to anyone but the most devout and powerful members of Hastur's faith.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Strange_Aeons.jpg","_id":"lHwUvGXQtmmX6JBD"}

If such a victim fails its save against Ithaqua's <i>nightmare</i> spell-like ability, the damage it takes from the ability is cold damage. Upon awakening, the victim is affected by a <i>geas/quest</i> to travel north beyond the arctic circle and, once there, await Ithaqua's arrival in a remote location. Whether or not the Great Old One comes to call is left to the GM to decide, but if Ithaqua does not visit within 1 month, the effects of the arctic dreams end.  </p><p><strong>Create Wendigo (Su)</strong> By using <i>wind walk</i> with a creature or by affecting it with his unspeakable presence, Ithaqua afflicts the creature with an enhanced version of wendigo psychosis.  <i>Wendigo Psychosis</i>: Curse-unspeakable presence or <i>wind walk</i>; save Will DC 36; <i>onset</i> immediate; frequency 1/hour; effect 1d6 Wis drain (minimum Wis 1). When a victim's Wisdom reaches 1, it seeks an individual of its race to kill and devour. After completing this act, the victim takes off at a run, and in 1d4 rounds sprints up into the sky at such a speed that its feet burn away into jagged stumps. The victim transforms into a wendigo (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2</i> 281) over the next 1d4 minutes. Once the transformation is complete, the victim is effectively dead, replaced by a wendigo. <i>Miracle</i>, <i>true resurrection</i>, or <i>wish</i> can restore such a victim to life, yet doing so does not harm the new wendigo. The save DC is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Great Old One Traits</strong> Rules for Great Old One traits like immortality, insanity, his mythic abilities, and otherworldly insight, and the base rules for unspeakable presence can be found on page 306 of <i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 4</i>.  </p><p><strong>Howl (Su)</strong> Once every 1d4 rounds as a swift action, Ithaqua can emit a forlorn howl that can be heard up to 10 miles away. Any who hear the howl must make succeed at a DC 36 Will save to avoid becoming shaken for 24 hours. Creatures within 360 feet of Ithaqua become panicked for 1d4+4 rounds, and those within 60 feet cower in fear for 1d4 rounds. Although this is a mind-affecting fear effect, immunity to fear does not offer full protection; a creature normally immune to fear must still succeed at a Will saving throw if within 60 feet to avoid becoming  shaken for 1 hour (immunity to fear functions normally against Ithaqua's howl at greater distances). The save DC is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Immortality (Ex)</strong> If Ithaqua is slain, his body explodes in a burst of frozen wind that deals 20d6 points of cold damage to all creatures within a 60-foot spread (Reflex DC 42 half; the save DC is Constitution-based). Ithaqua reforms with full hit points 1 year later in another world's arctic region, but cannot return to the world on which he was slain via <i>interplanetary teleport</i> for another 10 years (or until outside agents allow for his travel to this world).  </p><p><strong>Immune to Storms (Ex)</strong> Ithaqua is immune to the effects of any storm or storm-like condition unless he chooses otherwise. This includes being affected by high winds and by spells like <i>ice storm</i> and <i>storm of vengeance</i>.  </p><p><strong>Snow Vision (Ex)</strong> Ithaqua can see perfectly well in snowy conditions, and does not take penalties on Perception checks when in snowy or blizzard conditions.  </p><p><strong>Unspeakable Presence (Su)</strong> Failing a DC 36 Will saving throw against Ithaqua's unspeakable presence has two effects. First, it exposes the victim to Ithaqua's create wendigo ability (see page 82). In addition, the creature gains vulnerability to cold and loses any resistance or immunity to cold it had; this condition persists for 24 hours. A creature that lacks any immunity or resistance to cold also becomes chilled by the Great Old One's presence, taking a -4 penalty on ranged attacks, initiative checks, Reflex saving throws, and Dexterity-based skill checks, as well as a -4 penalty to Armor Class. These penalties last for 24 hours.  </p><p><strong>Wind Walk (Sp)</strong> If Ithaqua pins a grappled foe, he can attempt to use <i>wind walk</i> with the grappled foe by using his spell-like ability-he automatically succeeds at all concentration checks made to use <i>wind walk</i> in this case. If the victim fails to resist the spell, Ithaqua hurtles into the sky with it. Each round, a victim can attempt a new DC 36 Will saving throw to turn solid again, but at this point it falls if it cannot fly. A creature affected by Ithaqua's <i>wind walk</i> in this way might begin transformation into a wendigo (see Create Wendigo on page 82), and eventually Ithaqua strands the victim in some rural area, often miles or even worlds away from where it began. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Also known as the Wind-Walker, Ithaqua has visited countless worlds during his travels throughout the universe. Whether he is able to visit only worlds with arctic circles and magnetic poles, or whether those worlds have such conditions because the Great Old One visited them in their earliest days is unclear.  Ithaqua appears as a 50-foot-tall primitive humanoid with glowing red eyes and unnaturally long arms, yet his feet are always cloaked in blasts of thick snow-laden and freezing winds.  <br /><strong>Ithaqua's Cult</strong><br />  Ithaqua is worshiped in arctic regions, primarily by cannibal tribes, giants, and wendigos. Those who fear starvation or the loss of morality might offer sacrifices to him out of fear-such sacrifices are traditionally performed by leaving a body draped in the highest possible boughs of a pine tree. Worship of the Wind- Walker below the arctic circle is rare, but not unheard of.  Additional details on Ithaqua, his cult, his domains and his favored weapon appear on page 68 of this book.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Strange_Aeons.jpg","_id":"lS6hQuu6Qo4BZx5E"}

Performing this transformation is somewhat painful, but the faceless hulk can maintain its new shape indefinitely once it has achieved that form. It can change back to its true form as a swift action, and it gains a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls, damage rolls, skill checks, and saving throws for 1 round after it does so. A faceless hulk retains its own innate abilities when it assumes its new form and does not gain any of the abilities of the creature it mimics. A faceless hulk gains a +10 bonus on Disguise checks when using this ability.  </p><p><strong>Explosive Expansion (Su)</strong> In its natural form, a faceless hulk can expand rapidly as a full-round action. It grows one size category larger, pushing back any creature or object in its new space. The faceless hulk can choose which direction (or directions) it expands from its original space, and it can attempt a free bull rush combat maneuver check against any creatures in these squares of sizes Large or smaller. The faceless hulk uses its increased size (usually Huge) to determine its Combat Maneuver Bonus for these checks. At the end of its turn, it immediately returns to its original size, though it can choose which squares it occupies when it does so. This ability does not change the faceless hulk's weight.  </p><p><strong>Faceless (Su)</strong> In its natural form, a faceless hulk has no discernible facial features. It gains a +4 bonus on saving throws made to resist attacks or effects that target the senses. This includes gaze attacks, odor-based attacks, sonic attacks, and similar attacks. This bonus does not apply to illusions.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Ugoroths are monstrous, sadistic beings created by aboleths in their long war against the surface world. Alongside their smaller cousins, the faceless stalkers (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2</i> 122), they work to destabilize surface-dwelling civilizations from within. During the war, the destruction of the aboleth city Voshgurvaghol left them leaderless and without direction. Though they have long forgotten the beings that created them, faceless hulks continue their original mission, driven only by a hatred for humanity that was molded into their very bodies. Some believe that ugoroths still serve their veiled masters, even without their own knowledge.  Faceless hulks range in height from 10 to 14 feet and weigh anywhere from 1,200 to 1,700 pounds.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Ugoroths have flexible, boneless bodies that resist various forms of attack. While they prefer to forgo armor whenever possible, they typically use whatever weapons and equipment are most common among the race they are disguised as. Though they lack many of the special abilities that make each giant race unique, they have managed to adapt facsimiles of several, enough to pass the scrutiny of all but the most discerning of observers. Some older ugoroths acquire magical items and artifacts to bolster themselves with abilities they would normally lack.  They cannot digest solid food even when they assume the forms of creatures with mouths. Instead, they subsist on liquids, especially blood. In their natural forms, they have three hollow tongues, which they use to penetrate and lap blood from smaller humanoids.  Historians are unsure whether aboleths created the first faceless hulks as part of a larger plot to infiltrate the land-dwelling peoples of Golarion or whether the  enlarged faceless stalkers simply evolved from their Medium-sized kin over time. Some scholars of ancient Azlant believe faceless hulks were crafted intentionally to infiltrate the cyclopes the Azlanti enslaved (and the cyclopes of the long-extinct kingdom of Ghol-Gan). Others defend the theory of independent evolution, citing the existence of even larger, older ugoroths (ugoloroths, which are described below) as proof that the faceless hulks of today are simply the descendants of an exceptionally large strain of faceless stalkers. Despite their disagreements, sages recognize that faceless hulks and faceless stalkers now form two distinct species.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Faceless hulks were originally created to sow discord and animosity between giants and other surface-dwelling races, to further weaken both during the war with the aboleths. Toward that end, ugoroths disguised themselves among the various giant races to attack and spread mayhem in humanoid society. A lone faceless hulk may take the form of a fire or frost giant before attacking a humanoid settlement. Others infiltrate giant tribes and raiding parties, living among them for months or years and manipulating them into causing great violence whenever possible. Greater faceless hulks, which prefer to take the shapes of cloud or storm giants, spend decades in disguise, sparking conflicts that can span generations.  Unlike typical giants, faceless hulks leave very few casualties in the wake of their attacks. Instead, they favor mass destruction, taking special care to level centers of commerce and locations of political import. These attacks also give them the opportunity to take prisoners they may later feed on in private. Faceless hulks have been known to work together with faceless stalkers to great success. Their smaller kin ensure that humanoid settlements are unprepared for giant attacks, and they later whip the survivors into a frenzy, driving them to retaliate against the giants. By working together this way, the two races can transform minor conflicts into explosive wars.  Some ugoroths believe they are the divine creations of the god Ghlaunder, who reigns over parasites and stagnation, while others cleave to the atheistic nature of their true creators, the aboleths. A few have taken to worshiping chaotic evil giant deities. Strangely, many faceless hulks consider themselves kin to evil giants, favoring them over their own kind. In some rare cases, they willingly choose to spend their entire lives among giants, pretending to be hermits or wandering sages. This is a particularly dangerous lifestyle for an ugoroth-after generations of slavery, many giants are naturally distrustful of those they don't know. If they discover an ugoroth hiding among them, giants hunt it down without mercy.  <br /><strong>Greater Faceless Hulks</strong><br /> Known as ugoloroths among their own kind, the largest and most ancient faceless hulks serve as spies and infiltrators within the societies of the largest races of giantkind, including cloud giants, storm giants, and taiga giants. An ugoloroth is a faceless hulk with the advanced and giant creature simple templates. It gains Combat Reflexes and Greater Bull Rush as bonus feats. It casts spell-like abilities as a 12th-level caster, and gains <i>levitate</i> and <i>undetectable alignment</i> as at-will spell-like abilities. When using its change shape ability, an ugoloroth can take the shape of any Huge humanoid. More so than their ugoroth kin, ugoloroths often take levels in classes such as barbarian, fighter, ranger, sorcerer, and witch to more easily pass as members of various giant races.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Strange_Aeons.jpg","_id":"mxZc53b4LBWTOwVq"}

Furthermore, when engorged with blood and thus visible, it takes a -10 penalty on Fly checks.  </p><p><strong>Loathsome Embrace (Ex)</strong> The slithering wet tentacles and suckered tendrils a star vampire uses to feed with and clutch its prey are particularly disgusting to experience. Any creature that is grappled by or that grapples a star vampire must attempt a DC 16 Will save to avoid being nauseated for 1 round. A new Will save is required each round the grapple is maintained, but  once a creature succeeds at its saving throw against a star vampire's loathsome embrace, it becomes immune to the loathsome embrace of all star vampires for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Partial Invisibility (Su)</strong> A star vampire is invisible in its natural state, although the eerie tittering it constantly emits makes locating it easier than normal-treat a star vampire as if it were in combat or speaking for the purposes of Perception checks against it. When a star vampire feeds on blood (either as a result of a successful blood drain attack or by gaining the benefit of its blood healing), it becomes visible, its nauseating appearance laid bare by the blood that infuses its entire being. A star vampire that becomes visible in this manner remains visible until it takes 2 consecutive rounds of bleed damage or 10 minutes pass after it last drained blood or gained the benefit of blood healing.  </p><p><strong>Scent Blood (Ex)</strong> A star vampire has the scent ability against all living creatures that have blood, and it gains a +10 circumstance bonus on Perception checks against creatures currently taking bleed damage.  </p><p><strong>Weakness to Bleed Effects (Ex)</strong> When subjected to a bleed effect, a star vampire suffers wracking pain that leaves it sickened as long as the bleed effect persists. Consumed blood drains rapidly from a star vampire's body when it is affected by a bleed effect, and after 2 consecutive rounds of bleed damage, a star vampire that had become visible after drinking blood becomes invisible once again.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Star vampires descend upon worlds to feed upon the blood of the living. Naturally invisible, star vampires expose their offensive shapes when they feed, for the blood they gorge upon infuses their bodies with a glistening crimson hue. Tangled masses of writhing feelers surrounding toothy maws, star vampires can extend three long tentacles tipped with talons to lacerate foes, allowing the aberrations to drink the blood from the air with thousands of tiny feeding tendrils.  A star vampire is approximately 10 feet in diameter, yet weighs a mere 300 pounds.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Star vampires are effectively immortal and can live forever if not slain through violence, accident, or disease. The bulk of these creatures drift through the vastness of the Dark Tapestry, but without the starflight ability (like that of byakhees; see page 82), thousands or even millions of years can pass before one manages to find a planet where it can descend to feed. Once a star vampire arrives on a planet, it adopts the new world as its personal feeding ground and very rarely, if ever, returns to space.  It is far more common for a star vampire to show up on a world after being conjured from the depths of  space via certain rare spells or rituals. Many of these rites are deliberately ambiguous promises of the aid of a powerful spirit from the depths of space-designed to serve up the unsuspecting occultist as a hungry star vampire's inaugural meal on the new world. The source of these dangerous rituals is unclear, for it is unlike the alien mind of a star vampire to conceive of such tactics. Likely, these treacherous spells were inflicted upon the world by a misanthropic lunatic eager to bring pain and doom upon those foolish enough to attempt to contact alien beings.  Star vampires either have no need or have lost the ability to reproduce, and thus their numbers in the universe are limited, dwindling as individuals perish. Yet, the sheer number of star vampires that drift through space, while spread thin, is vast enough that the vampiric race is in no danger of going extinct any time soon.  The strange noises issued by a star vampire seem to serve no purpose, although they tend to sound like mocking laughter at times. These creatures can speak if they wish (although few know any language other than Aklo), but their voices are wet and slobbery and do not prevent the tittering sounds they emit from continuing- only when feeding do these monsters fall relatively silent.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Ancient beyond most worlds, whatever realm first spawned these interstellar predators is long gone, vanished even from the memories of the star vampires themselves, along with any culture or name for themselves they may have once had. Yet, the star vampires do not mourn this loss. They have no need for companionship, no desire to leave a legacy, and no drive to colonize new worlds, for their minds and motivations are as alien as their strange shapes to most planet-bound societies.  Some star vampires grow mightier than the typical specimen presented here, gaining size and Hit Dice with no apparent limit- although when they grow particularly large, they are invariably hunted down and destroyed by great heroes on the worlds they infest. Other star vampires gain class levels to become more powerful, preferring to focus on classes such as oracle, psychic, and rogue, eschewing classes that place too much emphasis on the use of gear or the acquisition of companions. Star vampires with class levels tend to pose more of a threat than those that merely grow in size, for the former often develop all-too-human goals and desires beyond simply feeding. These creatures are fond of forming cults and playing  the role of gods to primitive societies or fanatics who are incapable of discerning the monster from a divine sending. It is rare for a star vampire to worship a deity, but those that do tend to venerate Nyarlathotep, Shub- Niggurath, or Yog-Sothoth.  <br /><strong>Origins</strong><br /> The creatures known now as \"star vampires\" were named such by Sandy Petersen in Chaosium's Call of Cthulhu Roleplaying Game, and they've gone on to drink the blood of countless inquisitive investigators and hapless heroes. The first star vampire noted in print lacked its name, appearing in Robert Bloch's short story, \"The Shambler from the Stars,\" which the author dedicated to H. P. Lovecraft-after receiving written permission to put Lovecraft into the story and have a monster eat him. Lovecraft returned the favor by having an equally grisly fate await a Bloch-inspired character in the short story, \"The Haunter of the Dark.\"</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Strange_Aeons.jpg","_id":"pwPa06GP5Ydo7MBO"}

The most common means by which one might contract this infestation is through nightmares that brush against Xhamen-Dor's influence in the Dimension of Dreams, after which the Inmost Blot can track victims and infest their thoughts, slowly and painfully driving them mad. Less common is direct exposure to one of the Great Old One's vine-choked thralls: the seeded.  Xhamen-Dor feeds upon a victim's force of personality, and as a result, only a select few who meet its inscrutable criteria are even able to contract the seedborne consumption disease that turns one into a seeded. Those infected first become sickly and withdrawn. Weeks later, the germinating evil within begins sending fibrous feelers throughout the victim's body. When the host finally slips into a catatonic coma, these fibers quickly digest the organs and portions of the flesh before animating the corpse from within like a puppet. Most victims maintain painful recollections of their former lives, yet they are driven to hear and obey the commands of Xhamen-Dor and find new victims to spread their plague.  <br /><strong>Creating a Seeded Creature</strong><br />  \"Seeded creature\" is an inherited template that can be added to any corporeal, living creature with a Charisma score of 12 or higher. A seeded creature uses the base creature's stats and abilities except as noted here.  <br /><strong>CR:</strong> Base creature's CR + 1.  <br /><strong>Alignment:</strong> Always neutral evil.  <br /><strong>Type:</strong> The creature's type changes to undead (augmented). Do not recalculate class Hit Dice, Base Attack Bonus, or saves.  <br /><strong>Senses:</strong> A seeded creature gains darkvision with a range of 60 feet.  <br /><strong>Armor Class:</strong> The fungal growths that appear on a seeded creature's body increase the base creature's natural armor bonus by 2.  <br /><strong>Hit Dice:</strong> Change all racial Hit Dice to d8s. Class Hit Dice are unaffected. As undead, seeded creatures use their Charisma modifiers to determine bonus hit points (instead of their Constitution modifiers).  <br /><strong>Defensive Abilities:</strong> A seeded creature gains channel resistance +4, damage reduction 5/bludgeoning or slashing, a +4 bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting effects, cold resistance 10, and electricity resistance 10, in addition to the defensive abilities granted by the undead type. A seeded creature also gains fast healing 5.  <br /><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> A seeded creature has the following weakness.  <br /><i>Transformed</i>: Although seeded creatures are undead, their bodies pulse with alien plant life. For the purposes of effects targeting creatures by type (such as a ranger's favored enemy and bane weapons), seeded creatures count as both undead and plants.  Seeded creatures are not immune to charms, compulsions, and mind-affecting effects from psychic sources, such as psychic spells or a creature's psychic magic ability. However, such effects have a chance to harm the source due to seeded creatures' insidious mind special attack (see below).  <br /><strong>Speed:</strong> A seeded creature retains all movement types and gains a climb speed equal to its base speed.  <br /><strong>Melee:</strong> A seeded creature gains two tendril attacks that each deal damage as per a tentacle of a creature one size category larger than the base creature's size. These tendrils are secondary attacks and also have the grab universal monster ability, and the seeded creature's reach with these attacks increases by 5 feet. Its natural weapons are treated as magic and evil weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.  <br /><strong>Special Attacks:</strong> A seeded creature gains several special attacks. The save DCs are equal to 10 + 1/2 the seeded creature's HD + the seeded creature's Charisma modifier unless otherwise noted.  <br /><i>Death Burst (Ex)</i>: When a seeded creature dies, it releases psychic spores. All creatures adjacent to the seeded creature are exposed to its seedborne consumption infestation (see below). Due to the spores' psychic nature, any effect that would completely deflect gases and similar airborne hazards grants protected creatures only a +5 bonus on saving throws against exposure.  <br /><i>Entrapping Tendrils (Ex)</i>: When a seeded creature succeeds at a combat maneuver check to pin a foe, it can attempt a second combat maneuver check to tie up the foe with a tendril as a swift action. Doing so causes it to lose one of its tendril attacks as long as it is keeping a creature tied up in this way, and a seeded creature can tie up only two creatures in this way before it runs out of spare vines. Each round that a creature remains tied up in this way, it is exposed to the seeded one's seedborne consumption until it is affected. In addition, every full day a victim remains tied up in this way is instead treated as though a month had passed for the purpose of the seedborne consumption disease. The tendrils each have hardness 5 and 10 hit points. If a creature tears free or destroys a tendril, the seeded  creature regrows enough of the vines that make up its tendrils to regain its lost tendril attack after 1 minute.  <br /><i>Insidious Mind (Su)</i>: When a seeded one succeeds at a saving throw against a psychic charm, a compulsion, or another mind-affecting spell or spell-like ability that would otherwise affect it, its dreams infect the spellcaster's mind, exposing him to seedborne consumption.  <br /><i>Seedborne Consumption (Su)</i>: natural or touch attack; save Fort DC = 10 + 1/2 the seeded one's HD + the seeded one's Charisma modifier; <i>onset</i> 1 month; frequency 1/month; effect 1d2 Charisma damage (this damage cannot be healed while the creature is infected); cure 3 consecutive saves. When a creature's Charisma is reduced to 0, instead of becoming unconscious it falls into a feverish mental state where its mind is scattered and inattentive. The creature can still move and perform actions, but it can concentrate on only a single action, and for only a few moments. It takes a -4 penalty on saving throws; Intelligence-, Wisdom-, and Charisma-based checks; and skill checks. Within 24 hours of a creature's Charisma score reaching 0, it dies and rises as a seeded creature.  <br /><strong>Ability Scores:</strong> Str +4, Wis +2, Cha +4. As an undead creature, a seeded creature has no Constitution score.  <br /><strong>Language:</strong> A seeded creature gains telepathy with a range of 100 feet, but only with other seeded creatures. Seeded creatures benefit from the morale bonuses granted by other seeded creatures within range of their telepathy.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Strange_Aeons.jpg","_id":"qEHLOf6fWp5P7EC7"}

He casts spells spontaneously, as per a sorcerer, but he can cast spells from any spell list. He can know up to two spells per spell level from 1st to 9th at any one time (and up to six 0-level spells at any one time), taken from any spell list. When he uses his consume spellcaster ability, he can swap out up to two spells currently known for any two spells known (and currently prepared in the case of prepared spellcasters) by his consumed victim. The only spells Tsathoggua can never know are those with the good or lawful descriptors. The spells listed above are those he favors, but GMs are free to alter that list as they <i>wish</i> for encounters with Tsathoggua.  </p><p><strong>Consume Spellcaster (Su)</strong> When Tsathoggua kills a spellcaster while using his feed ability, the spellcaster's body shrivels into what appears to be a long-dead mummified corpse. Tsathoggua can learn any two spells known by the spellcaster (see adaptive spellcasting above) when he kills a spellcaster in this way, and he regains a number of hit points equal to the total number of spell levels still uncast by the consumed victim.  </p><p><strong>Create Spawn (Su)</strong> Once every hour as a standard action, Tsathoggua can emit 1d4 formless spawn from his body. These newly created formless spawn have free will and are fully grown, but they follow Tsathoggua's commands for 1d4 days after creation. Tsathoggua sometimes gifts newly created spawn to visitors he favors. Sometimes he just eats them. Those spawn that escape servitude or digestion slither off into the world on their own.  </p><p><strong>Feed (Su)</strong> Whenever Tsathoggua deals bite damage to a creature, he drinks away vital essence, sanity, and bodily fluids alike. This causes 1d4 points of ability drain to all six ability scores. A successful DC 44 Fortitude saving throw reduces the 1d4 points of ability drain to only one ability score, chosen by Tsathoggua. The save DC is Constitution-based.  </p><p><strong>Great Old One Traits</strong> Rules for Tsathoggua's Great Old One traits such as immortality, <i>insanity</i>, his mythic abilities, otherworldly insight, and unspeakable presence can be found on page 306 of <i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 4</i>.  </p><p><strong>Immortality (Su)</strong> If Tsathoggua is slain, his body tears open and creates a burst of vile ooze that deals 20d8 points of acid damage to all creatures within a 60-foot spread. A total of 2d6 formless spawn immediately form in random spots throughout this area of effect, while the remainder of the gore seeps into the ground, reforming into Tsathoggua in a deep cavern on another world after 1d100 months have passed. All portals in Tsathoggua's domain that connect to the world on which he was slain deactivate and must be manually repaired by the Great Old One, a process that can take years or even decades but does not bar his return to that world via other means.  </p><p><strong>Item Creation (Su)</strong> Tsathoggua is treated as having all item creation feats for the purposes of crafting magic items.  </p><p><strong>Outcast's Dreams (Su)</strong> Tsathoggua can affect any creature with outcast's dreams that has succumbed to the Great Old One's unspeakable presence or that has ever offered him prayer or physically touched an altar dedicated to him within the walls of a still-standing temple of Tsathoggua. When Tsathoggua uses <i>nightmare</i> on such a target, the victim must also succeed at a DC 38 Will saving throw or feel cast out of society and spurned by friends and loved ones. The victim cannot benefit from the aid another action or provide aid to others, it must always attempt saving throws against beneficial spell effects if saving throws are allowed, and it takes a -4 penalty on all attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks when any other creature of its type is within 30 feet of it. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Powerful Blows (Ex)</strong> Tsathoggua's bite and claw attacks always apply 1-1/2 times his Strength modifier to damage.  </p><p><strong>Unspeakable Presence (Su)</strong> Failing a DC 38 Will saving throw against Tsathoggua's unspeakable presence causes the victim to perceive Tsathoggua as its only ally; it treats all other creatures as enemies and does what it can to defend Tsathoggua and obey the Great Old One's commands, as if under the effects of <i>dominate monster</i>. This effect persists for as long as the victim remains within 300 feet of Tsathoggua. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Known variously to his worshipers as the Father of Night, Saint Toad, the Sleeper in the Deep, and other appellations, Tsathoggua is among the more enigmatic of the Great Old Ones. Not only does he often interact with mortal life, but  he has at times done so in a friendly or even charitable manner. Yet these moods are mercurial, and the Great Old One tires of company and attempts to eat those he had been aiding only a moment before. Those who worship him generally do not display this level of magnanimity; they are typically fanatic and violent in their methods of preserving the secrets of their sect.  Tsathoggua appears as a bloated toadlike creature, covered with fur and wearing a strange, sleepy expression on his bat-like face.  <br /><strong>Tsathoggua's Cult</strong><br />  Tsathoggua's worshipers often venerate him as a god of magic. They rarely gather in large groups, with most of his cultists being loners or outcasts who dwell at the fringes of society or in the wilderness. The presence of well-preserved Tsathogguan temples on many worlds suggests that at one point in the distant past, his followers were both more plentiful and more willing to work in larger groups, but today these temples lie abandoned save by monsters, the Great Old One's spawn, and a handful of clerics (or just a lone devoted and powerful priest). Tsathoggua grants access to the domains of Chaos, Evil, Knowledge, and Magic and to the subdomains of Arcane, Divine, Thought, and Whimsy (<i>Pathfinder Campaign Settings</i>: <i>Inner Sea Gods</i> 227). Tsathoggua's favored weapon is the short sword.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Strange_Aeons.jpg","_id":"quaNuitXVTno6qVP"}

This sonic effect extends out to a 30-foot radius, though a creature can still hear the cacophony from a distance without being affected. Creatures in the area take a  -4 penalty on Perception checks involving hearing, and all creatures in the area have a 25% chance each round of being nauseated for 1 round. Any creature subject to the nauseating effect of this ability can negate the nausea with a successful DC 20 Fortitude saving throw. In addition, any creature casting a spell in the area must succeed at a concentration check (DC = 15 + the level of the spell being cast) or lose the spell. After initiating this effect, a druj nasu can maintain the effect each round as a free action and can dismiss it as a move action.  </p><p><strong>Swarmwalking (Su)</strong> A druj nasu is immune to damage or distraction effects caused by swarms.  </p><p><strong>Untouched By Flame (Su)</strong> Any undead animated by a druj nasu or any swarm summoned by this div gains the druj nasu's immunity to fire.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Foul corruptors of the dead, druj nasus are divs that haunt funeral pyres, mausoleums, and burial sites to steal corpses. They represent the uncleanness of the body and corrupting forces that can prevent a creature's proper passage into the afterlife. Some scholars claim that in ancient times these creatures' interference caused numerous cultures to alter their practices regarding burial.  When a druj nasu was found near a body that was to be buried, the body would be considered unclean. An unclean body couldn't be buried and the sacred flames of a funeral pyre would only spread the taint to the winds, so some ancient people would then carry the corpse up the side of a cliff or mountain and have the birds and other animals clean the flesh from the bones before the deceased could be interred with the necessary rites to ensure a proper passage into the Great Beyond.  Unlike other corpse thieves, druj nasus don't take the bodies of the deceased in order to feast upon the rotting flesh. The divs do this to spite the survivors and bring greater grief and sorrow to the family and loved ones of the dead. After pilfering the bodies, the divs watch from afar as the grieving family sinks deeper into sadness. They then animate the stolen remains and, since they have no innate ability to influence these creations, use their <i>command undead</i> spell-like ability to send the shambling corpse back to prey upon its former loved ones. In this way, druj nasus disrupt polite society and commit one of the ultimate cultural taboos.  Because druj nasus, like all divs, are a scourge on humanity's accomplishments, these foul fiends are a constant target of good faiths. They are particularly hated by followers of Pharasma because of their treatment of corpses and proclivity for animating the remains they steal. Druj nasus generally ignore Pharasmins, however, and instead focus on their own mockery of the living. Because of an unknown, ancient conflict in Kelesh, druj nasus have a strong hatred for Sarenrae and her worshipers, going so far as to single them out in combat  and steal away the bodies of the clergy and faithful. Sarenrae's devoted find combating these divs frustrating due to their immunity to fire.  A druj nasu stands roughly 6 feet tall and weighs a slight 100 pounds.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p> All divs have some manner of esoteric weakness, and druj nasus have a strange negative reaction to common dogs. The divs flee from them in flight or ignore all other creatures and threats in order to kill them. Strangely, this reaction doesn't apply to supernatural doglike creatures like hell hounds or cerberi (Pathfinder <i>RPG Bestiary 3</i> 51), but they are particularly hateful toward or frightened of hound archons. Morticians and priests who are aware of the predations of these divs often keep dogs around to help ward off the fiends. Though druj nasus have no weakness against the sun, these divs tend to do their hunting at night when there are fewer watchful eyes.  In combat, druj nasus use their droning ability to weaken and incapacitate their enemies, and then <i>summon swarm</i>s of biting insects to wash over them, often doing so under the protection of <i>invisibility</i>. Once their foes are subjected to the distracting nature of the swarms, the div closes into melee range, taking full advantage of its swarmwalking ability. Against enemies that outnumber them or are more powerful, the divs make great use of flyby attacks, often paired with <i>invisibility</i>, to keep out of reach.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p> Druj nasus make their home in Abaddon, but, like most divs, they visit the Material Plane whenever they have the chance so that they can wreck the accomplishments and creations of humankind. These divs are most plentiful in Katapesh, Kelesh, Qadira, and Thuvia, but they can be found anywhere in the world. Druj nasus favor desert climates, but they don't spend much time in the open deserts, choosing instead to stick to places where people throng and plenty of dead bodies can be found and corrupted. These divs tend to stick to the outskirts of larger settlements, typically where the burial sites are located.  In regions where a druj nasu takes up residence, undead are a particular problem. These uncontrolled undead roam the countryside causing strife and danger to the area's inhabitants. These cruels divs also haunt nearby communities. They hide using their <i>invisibility</i> spell-like ability and spoil people's stores of food and communal water wells using their <i>putrefy food and drink</i> spell-like ability. For communities with large  stores of food and drink, divs continuously return until the settlements are on the verge of starvation. Druj nasus also use this ability to taint holy water fonts found in temples and shrines. These divs delight in sending plagues of insects to swarm through fields and towns to harass those living nearby.  Typically, druj nasus are loners, but they sometimes work in small groups to achieve a task before disbanding and going their respective ways. They are not particularly opposed to working with other divs, but when they do so they get along the best with pairakas, with whom they share a desire to spread disease and personal strife.  On the Material Plane, ghuls (Pathfinder <i>RPG Bestiary 3</i> 125) frequently inhabit the same kinds of spaces that druj nasus haunt. This leads the two creatures to compete over the theft of corpses; more often than not, such conflicts are won by the divs. Since divs can tolerate the burning rays of the sun better than ghuls, these divs gain a greater advantage in successfully stealing corpses.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Strange_Aeons.jpg","_id":"rB3VSodgDXuUwpYU"}

A <i>doom</i>ed creature gains the shaken condition. An already shaken creature that takes damage from an Ib shade must succeed at a DC 16 Will save to avoid becoming damned instead. A damned creature becomes so haunted by the certainty of its own imminent destruction that it is dazed for 1 round and then staggered for 1d6 rounds thereafter. This is a mind-affecting curse effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Ghost Touch (Ex)</strong> An Ib shade's webbed hands can manipulate solid objects (but not creatures) as if the objects had the <i>ghost touch</i> special ability. This allows Ib shades to wield weapons if they desire (although most eschew weaponry in favor of their more dangerous wracking touches) and to work together to carry large objects (such as statues of Bokrug). An Ib shade uses its Charisma score instead of its Strength score for determining how much weight it can carry, lift, or drag.  </p><p><strong>Voiceless (Ex)</strong> An Ib shade has no voice and cannot speak or take any verbal action as a result. An Ib shade that  gains a level in a spellcasting class automatically replaces any verbal components required by its spells with thought components (see page 144 of <i>Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures</i> for rules on thought components).  </p><p><strong>Wracking Touch (Su)</strong> An Ib shade's incorporeal touch causes painful wounds that manifest as wracking burns, deep bruises, or, in the case of attacks made against objects or constructs, crumbling fissures. This damage is treated as bludgeoning, slashing, and piercing, but it also counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. Against foes who are dazed or shaken by an Ib shade's <i>doom</i> ability (see above), successful melee attacks are treated as confirmed critical hits. An Ib shade's wracking touch is a primary touch attack.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Untold eons ago, in the land of Mnar in the Dreamlands, a strange race of amphibian humanoids (rumored to have descended from the depths of space) built a city of gray stone-naming it Ib-on the shores of a deep lake to and from which no river or stream flowed. These beings dwelt in Ib for ages, worshiping their deity Bokrug and performing their own curious rites and rituals until they were slaughtered by humans who were disturbed by the creatures' strange appearances and frightening deity. One thousand years later, the ghosts of this slaughtered race rose from the waters of that lake and descended upon the human city of Sarnath, bringing with them a terrible <i>doom</i> that brought death to all and wiped the mighty metropolis from existence, leaving only a swampy shoreline in its wake with the rising of the next sun.  An Ib shade is a nauseating green color. Its hands and feet are webbed and its body limber and lithe, with a sunken belly. The shade's face is froglike, with wide, flabby lips, but it has no eyes in its overly large eye sockets. Its ears are long and taper to two distinct points that protrude backward from the skull at an angle, with a third point descending downward to the shoulder in place of an earlobe.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Ib shades are much more violent and dangerous than their living counterparts; while alive, they were mild, aquatic fisherfolk, but as undead they threaten all who cross worshipers of Bokrug with vengeful wrath. These creatures have been known to rise up from nearby bodies of water to assault settlements and cities whose denizens have brought harm to the worshipers of the Water Lizard, and in the worst cases, have caught Bokrug's attention, leading to that site's ultimate destruction. Beyond this, Ib shades are content to remain hidden in the shallow waters of the bogs and lakes in which they once dwelt, coexisting in relative peace with animals but taking great and violent offense against intelligent intruders into their domains.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  If the Ib shades had a name for their race back in the days they lived, such a word has long been lost to the gulfs of time. Today, when scholars speak of these creatures, they refer to them as the \"beings of Ib.\" In life, they were amphibious creatures with weak frames and slimy, fragile skin. They were not warlike, but rather were content to spend their lives in worship of their god Bokrug, hunting and fishing for small game, and pursuing idle entertainments. Curiously, they never built their cities underwater, preferring to raise their squat, functional buildings on swampy lakeshores where the ground was firm enough to support stone edifices.  The beings of Ib were relatively peaceful in life and never presented much in the way of ambition or drive to be anything more than simple lake dwellers. The singular exception concerned their worship of Bokrug, the Water Lizard. The beings of Ib were fanatical devotees of the Great Old One, and the construction of intimidating but masterfully carved statues of the deity from strange, sea-green stone was always the first task these amphibious creatures undertook after settling on a lakeshore.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Strange_Aeons.jpg","_id":"wlzPV6V4VOG7bZ0X"}

This effect cannot be dispelled or suppressed. The Watcher can see into and out of water with perfect ease, and its vision is never impaired by water. It can see underwater as far as it can see on land, regardless of the water's level of obscurity. Water never provides cover from the Watcher in the Bay. As a free action, the Watcher can shift its vision to view the world through the eyes of any mutant created by its transformation ability, provided the mutant is within 10 miles of the Watcher. The Watcher in the Bay can determine the location of all mutants it has created within this 10-mile radius as if via <i>status</i>.  </p><p><strong>Insanity (Ex)</strong> Any creature that attempts to interact directly with the Watcher in the Bay's thoughts (such as via <i>detect thoughts</i> or telepathy) must succeed at a DC 33 Will save or be driven permanently insane (as per <i>insanity</i>, or the <i>insanity</i> rules on page 250 of the <i>Pathfinder RPG GameMastery Guide</i>, in which case this save DC is also the starting DC for the save to recover from the <i>insanity</i>). When the Watcher uses its telepathy to communicate with creatures, this ability doesn't activate unless the watcher focuses its mind on one opponent as a standard action. The save DC is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Otherworldly Insight (Ex)</strong> The Watcher gains a +10 insight bonus on initiative checks and to its AC and CMD.  </p><p><strong>Powerful Tentacles (Ex)</strong> The Watcher's tentacles are a primary attack, and the Watcher adds 1-1/2 times its Strength bonus to damage rolls with the tentacles.  </p><p><strong>Swallow Whole (Su)</strong> A creature swallowed by the Watcher suffers Charisma drain. Each round the Watcher inflicts Charisma drain in this manner, it regains 5 hit points per point of Charisma drained. A creature drained to 0 Charisma is transformed (see Transformation).  </p><p><strong>Transformation (Su)</strong> When a swallowed creature is drained to 0 Charisma by the Watcher, it instantly transforms into a hideous, warped mockery of its previous form. The swallowed creature gains the mutant template (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 5</i> 180), and its alignment becomes chaotic evil. When a creature gains the template, all Charisma drain inflicted on the creature by the Watcher's swallow whole attack is healed. The Watcher can regurgitate a transformed mutant as an immediate action. A mutant created in this manner is free-willed, but regards the Watcher as its mother and obeys the Watcher's commands without question when they are given. These mutants are immune to the Watcher's unspeakable presence.  </p><p><strong>Unspeakable Presence (Su)</strong> The Watcher in the Bay emanates an aura that inflicts intense mental anguish and torment on all creatures within 300 feet that can see and hear the Watcher. Any subjected creature must succeed at a DC 33 Will save or become staggered by this anguish for 1 round. A creature that successfully  saves against the Watcher's unspeakable presence in 2 consecutive rounds is immune to the Watcher's unspeakable presence for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Strange_Aeons.jpg","_id":"zIlWlkLJ7NHHzYiA"}

When Ghatanothoa uses his <i>nightmare</i> spell-like ability on such a target, the victim has a vivid <i>dream</i> of experiencing the end of the world in a fiery, destructive apocalypse-be it from asteroid impact, devastating floods, volcanic eruption, or anything else at the GM's whim. Upon waking, the conviction that such an apocalypse is only days, if not hours, away haunts the victim. In addition to suffering the normal effects of the <i>nightmare</i>, the victim must succeed at a DC 37 Will saving throw or be staggered with hopelessness for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Create Mummified Creature (Su)</strong> Any creature slain by Ghatanothoa's swallow whole attack is immediately transformed into a mummified creature (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 4</i> 196) under Ghatanothoa's control. As a free action, Ghatanothoa can disgorge any number of swallowed mummified creatures into adjacent squares. As a swift action, Ghatanothoa may make a touch attack against a creature that has mummified fully as a result of his unspeakable presence to transform that creature into a mummified creature under his control (no save).  </p><p><strong>Great Old One Traits</strong> Full rules for Ghatanothoa's immortality, <i>insanity</i>, his mythic abilities, and otherworldly insight, as well as the base rules for his unspeakable presence, can be found on page 306 of <i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 4</i>.  </p><p><strong>Immortality (Ex)</strong> If Ghatanothoa is killed, his form and all perfect images of his likeness lose their unspeakable presence ability (see page 85). Ghatanothoa's body shrivels and compresses in on itself, growing hard and leathery as it mummifies and contracts in size to a Huge object with AC 24, hardness 30, and 200 hit points. These remains are immune to cold damage, take half damage from fire and electricity, and take 150% damage from acid. An <i>earthquake</i> manifests (as per the spell at CL 29th) each round thereafter, centered on the location where Ghatanothoa was slain (his remains never take damage from the effects of these <i>earthquake</i>s). If Ghatanothoa's remains are not destroyed within 1 minute of his death, the remains explode in a blast of negative energy with a 600-foot radius that deals 20d6 points of negative energy damage to all creatures within that area (Reflex  DC 43 half). A creature killed by this damage is immediately transformed into a mummified creature (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 4</i> 196). If the remains are destroyed before this occurs, they crumble to dust without exploding. In either case, as soon as the remains are destroyed or explode, the <i>earthquake</i> effect in the region ends. Once this occurs, Ghatanothoa is reborn from one of the hidden cysts deep within his island lair. If his remains were destroyed before they could explode, he stays dormant in his lair until outside influences awake him once again (this could be a complex ritual performed by cultists, an astronomical event, or any natural disaster that strikes the region). If his remains were allowed to explode, Ghatanothoa wakes immediately and his unspeakable presence ability once again functions as detailed below. The save DC is Constitution-based.  </p><p><strong>Overwhelming</strong> </p><p><strong>Devastation (Ex)</strong> As a standard action, Ghatanothoa can assault a structure, dealing 10d6+31 points of damage to the structure in that round. This damage bypasses all hardness the structure has.  </p><p><strong>Unspeakable Presence (Su)</strong> Any creature failing a DC 39 Will save against Ghatanothoa's unspeakable presence becomes afflicted with a horrific curse. Ghatanothoa's unspeakable presence is so potent that even perfect images of the Great Old One can have this effect-a \"perfect image\" can either be a <i>projected image</i> created by Ghatanothoa, a perfectly rendered statue or painting (this requires an expenditure of 100,000 gp in resources, a successful DC 50 Craft [painting or sculpture] check, and a <i>wish</i> by someone who has suffered from Ghatanothoa's unspeakable presence), or any other representation at the GM's whim. Fortunately, the saving throw to resist this effect from a \"perfect image\" is only DC 20 (DC = 10 + Ghatanothoa's Charisma modifier).  If a creature fails to resist this curse, it immediately takes 1d10 points of Dexterity drain per round as its body begins to swiftly mummify. If the creature averts its gaze from Ghatanothoa, this drain is reduced to 1 point per round. As soon as a creature's Dexterity score is drained to 0, it transforms into a perfectly preserved and completely immobile mummy, yet the victim does not die. A creature mummified in this way no longer needs to eat, drink, or breathe, and no longer ages. It is essentially immortal, and can observe the world around it (and may even take purely mental actions, including the use of psychic magic), but can take  no other actions. No magical effect can end this condition (even if the victim's Dexterity drain is healed) save for an effect that removes the curse. This is a curse effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Ghatanothoa is a horrific monstrosity who, fortunately, is imprisoned on an island on a distant world. Yet even an image of this Great Old One has the potential to wreak havoc and destroy lives. Ghatanothoa's form is singularly repulsive-a tangle of arms, legs, eyes, mouths, and other body parts capable of shifting its composition at a whim, yet always retaining a definite and abhorrent shape.  Ghatanothoa's Cult  Few humans worship Ghatanothoa, but certain sects of mi-go (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 4</i> 193) have long revered this Great Old One. His temples are typically stone buildings on remote, desolate islands. Ghatanothoa grants access to the domains of Destruction, Evil, Madness, and Water and to the subdomains of Catastrophe, Insanity, Nightmare, and Oceans. His favored weapon is the morningstar.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Strange_Aeons.jpg","_id":"zL0R3SlxhmUnqgA7"}
