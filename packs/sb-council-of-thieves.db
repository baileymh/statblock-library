The save DC is Constitution-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Violent xenophobes, the creatures typically called nihilois, devashades, or shadow lords pose a rising threat to interlopers into their umbral realm. In ages immemorial, these creatures enjoyed vast empires upon the mysterious Plane of Shadow, but through the millennia incursion by immigrants and interlopers have eroded their way of life and scattered their numbers. In the face of spellcasters from the Material Plane striding across their homeland-using it as little more than a umbral thoroughfare-and whole terrible races like kytons migrating to their native reaches, the nihilois have long retreated into the deepest darknesses of their realm. Yet as alien encroachment continues, slowly the nihilois have revealed themselves, and found to their surprise that they are powerful and feared.</p><p>Nihilois-as the first travelers from Golarion termed them, believing them to be members of an ancient mythical race-resemble gaunt, vaguely humanoid creatures shrouded in ever-writhing shadow stuff with fountains of dark tendrils jutting from their backs. They often hold these thin limbs in tight bunches that appear like strange, dense wings, but unfurl them easily and with shocking speed to lash out against their enemies.</p><p>Unable to vocalize words, nihilois are widely distrusted by creatures foreign to the Plane of Shadow. Even a pair of the shadowy natives is unsettling to those encountering them for the first time as they silently gesture and nod, holding secret councils few others can understand.</p><p>Creatures frequently interacting with them know the nihilois have a shared name for their race, though since these creatures speak only telepathically, the term sounds more like the passage of massive wings than a word pronounceable in most sentient tongues.<strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong><br /> Artisans of the Plane of Shadow, with a near-peerless understanding of that realm, nihilois can, like sculptors, twist and manipulate the very fabric of their home plane. Birthed from the dark plane, these natives are as true inhabitants of their realms as the denizens of the Material Plane are of theirs. The ever-changing gloom of the plane permeates these creatures, and they likewise prove dark and changeable. Yet as the nature of shadow is to flee from the light, so too do nihilois find it natural to retreat from interlopers into their realm.</p><p>Having done so since times unrecorded, only in recent centuries has a new sentiment grown among these shadow lords, a feeling that they are losing an important battle and that both their survival and their realm are threatened. Thus, slowly over the span of centuries, resistance to foreign invaders has gradually become a hallmark of this mysterious race.</p><p>Nihilois, both male and female, stand nearly 7 feet tall, but often raise themselves up off the ground on coils of their dark tendrils. Those thick bunches of thin limbs that extend from their backs they typically hold together in dense clusters, causing them to appear like wings, but can unravel them and bring them to bear with incredible swiftness. Having a highly malleable form, nihilois are light, weighing an average of 65 pounds.</p><p>When angered, they can temporarily inflate themselves to appear larger, whipping their tendrils around in a fierce display. In addition to serving as weapons and locomotion, nihiloi tentacles are used to feed as well. When tightly wrapped around or within a meal, the tendrils secrete a digestive acid and absorb nutrients through tiny openings.<strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong><br /> Nihilois prove exceedingly rare, most having retreated to the farthest-flung depths of the Plane of Shadow where their numbers have dwindled. With rising frequency, though, many have shrugged off their race's fear of interlopers and come to lurk in the shadow reflections of cities on the Material Plane. In such eerie metropolises, groups of nihilois form tightly knit cells, with small groups potentially claiming districts as their own or splitting entire shadow cities between themselves. Quick to influence and master lesser shadow creatures-such as shadows, shadow garms, and fetchlings- nihilois can draw surprisingly large populations of shadow creatures to a single location. While large clusters of such beings don't overtly threaten the Material Plane, such is true only so long as the natives of that plane stay within their realm. Those spellcasters who step from their city homes onto the Plane of Shadow might find the land far less deserted than is typical for the plane, a realm of living shadow and hostile, glowing eyes. Outside such cities or group settings, lone nihilois hunt down interlopers into their realm, shadowing trespassers until the time is right to strike. While slaying such intruders satisfies their need for vengeance, all nihilois also seek out portals leading onto the Plane of Shadow and destroy such passages however they can, striving toward a day when all know to avoid the nighted realm.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Council_of_Thieves.jpg","_id":"8ch4Rt9bXrbib3tU"}

Although it cannot fly, a falling shadowgarm always descends as if under the effects of a feather fall spell, and thus never takes falling damage. </p><p><strong>Light Fixation (Su)</strong> Although a shadowgarm is not particularly harmed by bright light, it prefers dim lighting. Magical light, on the other hand, causes a shadowgarm to grow slow and lethargic. Whenever a shadowgarm is within an area of bright light that is magically created, it is staggered. </p><p><strong>Shadow Blend (Su)</strong> In conditions of dim light, a shadowgarm's outline wavers and blends with the surrounding shadows, granting it concealment (20% miss chance) even if its opponents are capable of seeing clearly in dim light. </p><p><strong>Shadow Slime (Su)</strong> A shadowgarm is coated with a thin layer of oily black slime. Whenever it strikes a foe, it transfers a swath of this cold black slime onto the creature struck. This slime causes a growing numbness and lethargy in the bodies of those it coats. Each time a creature takes damage from a shadowgarm's claws, the creature struck must make a DC 13 Fortitude save or take a cumulative -2 penalty to its Dexterity score. A creature whose total Dexterity penalty equals its Dexterity score is paralyzed and blinded as long as the penalty remains in effect. All accrued Dexterity penalties fade an hour after the last time the victim was affected by shadow slime, but any new shadow slime resets the recovery period. Exposure to bright light of any sort causes the Dexterity penalty to lessen by 2 points per round until all of the shadow slime is effectively \"burned away\" by the light. A shadowgarm is immune to the effects of its shadow slime and the shadow slime of other shadowgarms. The save DC is Constitution-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Shadowgarms are strange monsters from the Plane of Shadow, where they function as lowly predators and pests somewhat akin to the Material Plane's coyotes, leopards, and similar hunting mammals. Yet to a creature unfamiliar with the workings of the Plane of Shadow, the shadowgarm is a hideous and frightening beast. Generally lairing in ruined sections of towns or dead-end alleys clogged with refuse during the day, they come out at night to prey upon creatures that stray too far from the safety of light.</p><p>These aberrant predators \"leak\" into the Material Plane anywhere the Plane of Shadow's influence is strong. Small groups of shadowgarms are occasionally seen lurking in old graveyards where undead (particularly shadows) are known to reside, and anywhere that has strong traditions of shadow magic tends to have a healthy population of shadowgarms lurking in out-of-the-way areas as well.</p><p>The typical shadowgarm measures about 4-1/2 feet long and weighs approximately 90 pounds, their bodies being strangely light, composed of a spongy dark matter and seemingly wisps of shadow itself. Some, however, grow to be much larger, though shadowgarms of all sizes prove especially adept at blending in among the shadows and detritus of their hunting grounds or crawling into crevices it seems creatures of their size would not be able to squeeze.</p><p><strong>Ecology</strong><br /> Strange beings with a little-understood physiology, shadowgarms prove endlessly hungry, taking sustenance from shadow as if it were water and drawing nutrition from the flesh of other creatures as their only source of food. Shadowgarms can eat and digest any sort of animal matter, from flesh to bone, converting them into little more than smoke and shadow. A creature left to a shadowgarm to feed upon leaves behind nothing but trappings of metal and similarly solid accessories.</p><p>A shadowgarm's physical form seems strangely fluid, proving slightly malleable and generalized. No two shadowgarms appear exactly alike, and even individuals of the race seem to gradually change, all the faster in areas of deep shadows. Regardless of their endless, fluid alterations, they retain three primary clawed appendages, which serve them in consuming meals and fighting. Their number of feelers or tentacle-like legs, however, is constantly in flux, numbering but two or three one moment and then multiplying to dozens the next. Shadowgarms do not have a mouth and hardly have heads to speak off-possessing only slight knobby protuberances that seem to have little role in guiding their motions. When ingesting matter, they slowly dissolve their meals, their bodies breaking down any organic substance they choose by resting upon their meal for a matter of moments. The entire process might be likened to a body-wide ingestion process similar to that of a fly, as matter is dissolved and subsumed by the shadowy hunter's bulk.</p><p>Once every several months, the urge to mate descends upon shadowgarms like a mass racial insanity. At this time, their natural aversion to their own kind is overwhelmed by a need to procreate. Shadowgarms are hemaphroditic, but cannot fertilize themselves- when a shadowgarm gathering begins, these creatures congregate in groups of up to a dozen, remaining in close proximity to each other for days at a time. The cycle that drives shadowgarm gatherings is nothing connected to the Material Plane-most scholars have been unable to determine what pattern the timing follows, if indeed there is a pattern at all.</p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong><br /> Although shadowgarms are quite active at all times on the Plane of Shadow, the realities of the Material Plane force them into the niche of nocturnal predator. Yet despite their hatred of light, they seem to need it in some strange way. Observers have noted that the creatures prefer to stand in actual shadows, rather than just in darkness, and seem to savor the ever-changing nature of the shadows themselves. It may be that shadowgarms abhor total darkness as much as light, though neither bright light nor utter darkness causes them physical harm. Most shadowgarms' hunts take place under the light of the full moon, or in the shadowy hours of dusk or dawn.</p><p>In cities where shadowgarms are common, they naturally gravitate to sewers or narrow alleys. This allows them the easiest way to quickly strike at unwary victims from above or below.</p><p>They do not build any sort of true nest or lair, preferring to remain constantly afoot in search of new prey. As shadowgarms have no fear of falling, they often clamber up to corners and niches at the tops of tunnels or just under rooftop overhangs, both to avoid any bright light that might be shining down from above and to lie in wait to ambush unsuspecting prey that walks underneath. This leads to the discovery of shadowgarms in truly unexpected and unnerving places, like in bell towers, within attics and crawl spaces, and even hidden amid cracks and loose shingles in old roofing. More than one child's tale of boogiemen or strange shapes lurking outside their windows might actually be attributed to the daring nocturnal wanderings of shadowgarms.</p><p>Shadowgarms are incredibly territorial, and usually do not nest together except during their mating gathering.</p><p>Shadowgarms immediately confront one another upon meeting. Pickpockets and other street urchins often share wild tales of shadowgarms battling fiercely in the alleyways and nighted dens, fighting with raw savagery instead of their more customary stealth. Some canny streetfolk use this territorial nature to trick competing shadowgarms into fighting each other, giving wanderers out after dark enough time to move through territories infested by these lurking hunters without being attacked.</p><p>Of course, this tactic doesn't work well in areas where large numbers of shadowgarms are known to skulk, as directing one's attention to avoid a single hunter might prevent a traveler from noticing other predators lying in wait in the shadows.</p><p>On rare occasions, a shadowgarm might take to the seas, stealing aboard a ship at dock and hiding in the hold. Once at sea, such hunters emerge nightly to prey upon the ship's crew. Since a shadowgarm melts away into shadow and fog when it dies, leaving no evidence of a corpse behind, this might be one explanation for mysteriously derelict ships found adrift on the waves with nothing living on board.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Council_of_Thieves.jpg","_id":"9SV5YHesWLkQmioD"}

Those failing a DC 27 Reflex save suffer 2d8+8 points of piercing damage and the kyton may make a combat maneuver check as an immediate action to grapple each victim with the animate chains. A successful save cuts the damage in half and avoids the grapple opportunity. Those successfully grappled by the chains become subject to the kyton's pull ability. A kyton cannot use its breath weapon again while it is grappling or pulling creatures with its breath weapon chains. Otherwise, it may use the breath weapon once every 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based. An ephialtes kyton's chains (hardness 10, hp 10, Break DC 26) can be broken, or attacked by making a sunder attempt. If the chain is currently grappling a target, the attacker gains a +4 circumstance bonus on the CMB check to sunder. Severing a chain deals no damage to a kyton.</p><p><strong> Chain Armor (Ex)</strong> The chains that adorn an ephialtes kyton grant it a +8 armor bonus, but are not treated as armor for the purpose of arcane spell failure, armor check penalties, maximum Dexterity, weight, or proficiency. </p><p><strong>Dancing Chains (Su)</strong> An ephialtes kyton can control up to four chains within 30 feet as a standard action, making the chains dance or move as it wishes. In addition, the kyton can increase these chains' length by up to 15 feet and cause them to sprout razor-sharp barbs. The chains attack as effectively as the kyton itself. If a chain is in another creature's possession, the creature can attempt a DC 22 Will save to break the ephialtes kyton's power over that chain. If the save is successful, the kyton cannot attempt to control that particular chain again for 24 hours or until the chain leaves the other creature's possession. An ephialtes kyton can climb chains it controls at its normal speed without making Climb checks. The save DC is Charisma-based. </p><p><strong>Entrapping Chains (Su)</strong> With a successful combat maneuver check, an ephialtes kyton may transfer an adjacent creature grappled by the kyton's breath weapon chains to the chains adorning its body, giving the target the pinned condition while the kyton deals with remaining foes. The kyton does not retain the grappled condition while pinning such creatures. Pinned victims can free themselves with a combat maneuver check to break the pin or an Escape Artist check. Other creatures can attempt to free pinned victims by making a sunder attempt (hardness 10, hp 10). An ephialtes kyton may entrap 1 Large, 2 Medium, 8 Small, 32 Tiny, or 128 Diminutive or smaller opponents.</p><p><strong> Pull (Ex)</strong> An ephialtes kyton has a +4 racial bonus on CMB checks made using its pull special attack.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Sadistic hunters and tormentors of all living souls, ephialtes kytons usually roam the planes in service to the lords of Hell and Shadow, but occasionally in pursuit of their own fell interests. They ruthlessly abduct the innocent and retrieve the damned, dragging their victims into the fires of Hell or the gnashing, wailing dark of the Plane of Shadow. They have no fear, tracking their chosen prey regardless of distance or challenge, and shackle dragons, giants, and humanoids alike for their eternal torturous rewards.</p><p>Ephialtes kytons travel in silent grace while cloaked in darkness, but drop their stealthy veils when ready to intimidate those they've come to collect or punish.</p><p>Then, their frightening gaze matches the deadly intent of the chains piercing their flesh. These animated, wrought iron bands serve as protection and weapons in the hands or claws of all kytons, but may also bind and lash their victims to the ephialtes' ever-bleeding hide to carry them into the Great Beyond. A typical ephialtes stands 25 feet tall and weighs over 15 tons with the combined burden of their deadly chains.<strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong><br /> An ephialtes kyton results from the ritual transformation of a lesser kyton which has slain or bound 999 mortal victims in the soulless dark of the Shadow Plane. Thereafter, it gains the ability to shadow walk and expand its access to other planes without waiting for summoners to request its services. Eternally vigilant and opportunistic, ephialtes kytons hunt for further victims for young kytons to practice upon.</p><p>Because of their honed expertise in capturing and tormenting souls, ephialtes are highly useful to the diabolical elite-both mortals and the immortal lords of Hell-who seek out ephialtes kytons as fell servants. Some kytons willingly align themselves with the rulers of Hell, taking further delight in the various torments available in that realm.<strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong><br /> Ephialtes kytons shepherd and rule over the entirety of kyton society.</p><p>Though not especially cunning compared to other fiends, they still possess a fierce loyalty to their own kind and adhere to a rigid hierarchy of power and achievement.</p><p>Their homes within the Plane of Shadow remain eternally hidden, with the sounds of flesh-flensing chains providing the only insight into their torturous methods. Few outsiders understand the purpose of these elaborate torments, though rumors suggest they further empower the ephialtes to ever-greater transformations.</p><p><strong>Summoning Ephialtes Kytons</strong><br /> As long as a conjurer doesn't interrupt an ongoing hunt, most ephialtes kytons relish being summoned, looking forward to the sport of chasing down newly assigned prey or punishing those who fail to properly bind them.</p><p>Any Charisma check made as part of the greater planar binding spell to convince an ephialtes kyton to undertake a mission other than the murder, abduction, or torture of specific victims suffers a -2 penalty.</p><p>Once an ephialtes kyton accepts an assignment, it demands 1,000 gp paid in black onyx or opals for every Hit Die its target possesses. If the summoner cannot pay the price in the required gems, the kyton only partially carries out the requested service-maiming instead of murdering, abducting for only a limited time (typically 1d4+3 days), or only torturing a victim until it answers a single question as part of an interrogation. If a summoner tries to force an ephialtes kyton to perform a different type of service or accept a different form of payment, the kyton takes offense and all of the summoner's future Charismarelated interactions with the ephialtes suffer a -2 penalty.</p><p>Once an ephialtes kyton has agreed to a task, only its assigned prey interests it.</p><p>Ephialtes kytons always offer to dispose of such victims by taking them to the Shadow Plane so they can help lesser kytons obtain the necessary number of souls to become ephialtes.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Council_of_Thieves.jpg","_id":"AjP717arKtbsbG2x"}

Any creature within 30 feet must make a DC 19 or be blinded for 1d6 minutes. A creature can defend against this effect in the same way it would a gaze attack. This is a sight-based effect. The DC is Constitution-based.</p><p><strong> Wing Razors (Ex)</strong> A giant stymphalides's metallic feathers are razor-sharp. In addition to being able to slash creatures with its wings as a melee attack, it may beat its wings, flinging two large, feathered shards at a single target. These wing razors deal 2d6 points of damage and cause bleed. A giant stymphalides can use this attack a number of time per day equal to its Constitution modifier.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Man-eating birds of prey, the rare creatures known as stymphalides stalk the arid plains and coastlines of Golarion in ravenous swarms, shredding warm-blooded animals and unwary travelers with their bladed feathers and dagger-like beaks. From a distance, stymphalides might easily be mistaken for cranes, ibises, or other longnecked birds, though in full sunlight their gleaming feathers and the haze of blood lingering from past meals are impossible to mistake.</p><p>Peculiarly, the feathers and beak of a stymphalides are made of steel, similar to the metallic hide of a gorgon.</p><p>The wings of stymphalides are as sharp as knives and often lacerate their prey as the birds swarm and beat their wings against their unfortunate victims' skin. Similarly, their beaks are supernaturally sharp and can pierce the tough hides of animal prey or the armor of those warriors foolish enough to hunt the creatures. Even if a victim of a stymphalides swarm's frenzied attacks manages to fend off the vicious creatures, the wounds caused by the birds continue to bleed long after being inflicted, and the victim often perishes from loss of blood before ever reaching help.</p><p>Most stymphalides stand approximately 2-1/2 feet tall and weigh little more than 40 pounds. Although mean-tempered and territorial, lone stymphalides prove relatively harmless, thus traveling in swarms of several dozen, relying on strength of numbers to bring down large or dangerous prey. Many tales also tell of enormous breeds of these monstrous birds, powerful enough to prey upon wyverns. These giant stymphalides are said to grow up to 13 feet tall and weigh over 250 pounds, with wingspans reaching upward of 25 feet. Such gigantic stymphalides are rarely seen, preferring to lurk upon desolate cliffs or even amid harsh extraplanar realms.</p><p><strong>Ecology</strong><br /> Unlike vultures and other birds of the deserts and plains, stymphalides do not scavenge carcasses, although they are not above driving away natural scavengers if a large, fresh kill looks particularly inviting. When traveling in flocks, stymphalides prove fearless predators, swooping in and swarming any creature that wanders into their territory. The birds actively hunt their prey, harrying and killing lone individuals or stragglers. The attacks of a stymphalides swarm often prove so vicious that the creatures can take to flight once they have wounded prey, wait for it to bleed to death, and return to pick the corpse clean.</p><p>Stymphalides generally avoid attacking large groups of people, unless the birds have gathered in a particularly sizable flock.</p><p>Stymphalides are not purely carnivorous. A lone stymphalides might resort to eating fruit and other plants if it is separated from its flock or food is scarce, and orchards and fields of crops have been devastated by stymphalides when great swarms of the birds, starving from overpopulation or lack of prey, migrate to new territories. Yet although the birds are omnivorous, they seem to prefer meat. Those plainsfolk or desert-dwellers whose livelihoods depend on livestock have learned to fear the sight of flocks of birds silhouetted against the sky, as herds of cattle and other grazing animals have been ravaged by their swarms.</p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong><br /> Most swarms of stymphalides roost near watering holes, rivers, and coastal cliffs, preying upon unfortunate creatures desperate enough to seek food or water so near to the dangerous birds' nests. The nests of stymphalides are frequently made from the bones of the creatures' prey, piled into macabre ziggurats upon which entire flocks of the birds rest. Particularly large flocks of the birds construct enormous nests, and giant stymphalides can create towers visible for miles.</p><p>When not at rest, flocks of the creatures soar high on warm currents of air, relying upon their keen eyesight to spot suitable prey far below. Because of their voracious appetites, flocks of stymphalides must claim a vast swath of territory to maintain their feeding habits. Stymphalides are fiercely territorial, and flocks of the birds frequently fight with one another in swooping aerial battles to determine possession of land.</p><p>Fortunately for the folk of civilized lands, stymphalides rarely encroach upon areas well traveled by humanoids and other creatures clever enough to bring down one of these metal-winged avians. Among the people of the plains, the metallic birds are often regarded as nearly legendary creatures. Stymphalides breed at an astonishing rate, however, and overpopulation and exhaustion of game frequently force extraordinarily large and deadly groups of the creatures to band together in search of new lands and new prey to devour.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Council_of_Thieves.jpg","_id":"Bc8zuw7AwotEF0Jv"}

This stat block assumes that all five cooling chambers are shut down, and that the pit fiend has five permanent negative levels.  You should adjust his stats as appropriate if this is not the case.</p><p><strong>  Staggered (Ex)</strong> Liebdaga is staggered, but as a standard action, he can focus his thoughts so that on the round immediately following he can act as if not staggered. The round after he acts as if not staggered, he becomes nauseated for 1 round, after which he returns to his normal, non-nauseated staggered condition. While focusing his thoughts, Liebdaga is considered flat-footed.  </p><p><strong>Tenacious Soul (Su)</strong> As an infernal duke, Liebdaga possesses an additional power beyond most pit fiends-his tenacious soul. This grants Liebdaga complete immunity to mindaffecting effects, but more impressively it allows him to recover from even the most devastating of wounds. If reduced to -25 hit points, the pit fiend dies, but a smoky, ghostly devilish form rises from his wounds-the pit fiend's soul. On the pit fiend's next action, his soul targets the body with a breath of life spell effect (CL 12th), healing the downed pit fiend 5d8+12 points of damage. If this healing brings his hit point total back up to -25 or higher, his fast healing kicks in-if it restores him to positive hit points, he revives and can continue to fight. If his soul is unable to restore the body to at least -25 hit points, the pit fiend is truly dead. At this point, the soul shrieks in frustration and rage-all creatures within 30 feet must make a DC 19 Will save or suffer 1d6 points of Charisma damage from this soul-shattering, madness-inducing howl (the save DC is Charisma-based), after which Liebdaga's soul moves on to Hell and must begin anew as a mass of mindless lemures- this effectively ends Liebdaga for good, preventing him not only from returning to Westcrown to seek revenge, but from ever returning to power in Hell itself.</p></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Council_of_Thieves.jpg","_id":"CUEaMokJ6AREsHwY"}

Aside from being sinisterly colored, hellfire functions like normal fire, except that half the damage dealt by hellfire is fire damage and the other half results from evil energy and is therefore not subject to being reduced by resistance to fire-based attacks. In addition, all of a chortov's spell-like abilities with the fire subtype produce hellfire instead of normal fire. </p><p><strong>Hellfire Soul (Su)</strong> Upon being reduced to 0 hit points, a chortov explodes in a blast of hellfire. All creatures within 25 feet take 6d6 points of damage from hellfire (see above; DC 22 Reflex save for half ). The save DC is Constitution-based. Upon exploding, the chortov's waning yet still raging soul lingers on as a creature of pure living hellfire. This creature has the same statistics as a Huge fire elemental, except that damage caused by its burn ability results from hellfire and it is not vulnerable to cold. Every round that this hellfire elemental exists, it loses 10 hit points until it dissipates completely. </p><p><strong>Infernal Bondage (Su)</strong> Chortovs wage Hell's wars not by choice, but due to powerful magical bondage. The armor that binds all chortovs bears an infernal curse that compels these murderous fiends to serve the will of their infernal masters. This compulsion can be temporarily dismissed by a break enchantment, dispel law, or dispel magic spell that overcomes a DC 25 dispel check. This frees the chortov of its bondage for 1d6 minutes, during which the baffled creature acts as though under the effects of the spell confusion. Destroying the armor via sundering attacks also frees the devil for 1d6 minutes, after which the armor magically reforms. A chortov's armor has hardness 13 and 45 hit points. </p><p><strong>Wrath (Su)</strong> The anger and hatred of chortovs is infectious. Any creature damaged by a weapon wielded by a chortov or a chortov's slam attack must make a DC 17 or be thrown into a haze of murderous rage, being treated as though under the effects of the spells confusion and rage. This mania lasts for 1 minute, but victims may retry their save to resist every round. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Towering, rage-wracked brutes enslaved to the will of Hell, chortovs fume upon the borders and ramparts of Hell's hinterlands, murderous deterrents to any who would besiege the shores of the infernal realm or seek to escape.</p><p>Born from the remains of souls not destined for Hell but damned nonetheless, chortovs carry with them the rage of those who have suffered the multiverse's cruelest injustice, and by the inescapable yoke of diabolical magic find themselves set upon the enemies of their merciless captors.</p><p>Trapped within grotesque bodies of writhing, porcine flesh and smoldering hellfire, these horrors hate all things- other creatures, their fate, and the lords who have ensnared them and forced them to serve even past damnation.</p><p>Standing over 20 feet tall, chortovs are mountains of flesh, muscle, and flame. Each weighing upward of 5 tons, these devils bear plates and bands of diabolical armor that serve as physical manifestations of the infernal sorceries that bind them as eternal slaves to Hell. Each chortov's armor is unique, often bearing images of the vaguely remembered torments their constituent souls once suffered. Their bodies, too, bear incongruities uncommon in other diabolical races, harkening toward the lawless natures of the soul-stuff from which these terrors are sculpted.</p><p><strong>Ecology</strong><br /> Not all souls damned to the depths of the Pit deserve their places therein. Trapped planar travelers, goodly souls slain as diabolical sacrifices, or captives who would otherwise face torments elsewhere upon the planes-all might become prisoners of any one of Hell's inescapable layers, eternally condemned to an unfair damnation. Yet Hell cares nothing for the souls that toil and suffer within its depths, all being fodder for the infinite exertions of the infernal machine. As frightened souls suffer over centuries of horror, losing what once existed of their individuality, those rightfully damned to the Pit join with the fundament of that realm, supplying the infernal realm with the terrible sustenance it requires to- over the span of eons-excrete forth mindless lemures. Yet souls not meant for Hell fail to sustain the plane, collecting in mindless spirit cancers of primal pain and blind rage. From these cysts of wrathful, unrighteous damnation, the powers of Hell forge chains in the shape of terrible armor, creating within gigantic, barely restrained beings of hatred and living hellfire, and turn them toward the enemies of the infernal realm. These towering blasphemies are the chortovs.</p><p>Despite being unwilling servants of devilkind, chortovs are irretrievable prisoners of Hell. As the processes by which the infernal realm torments, destroys, and refines souls into the stuff of fiends last for innumerable centuries, and as untold numbers of the damned comprise a single devil, no remnant of individual lives, ambition, or memory remains within these gigantic terrors. Yet despite a lack of specifics, all chortovs are consumed by an overwhelming understanding that they are slaves to a hated master and the impotent knowledge that, for all their might and wrath, the one thing they can never strike against is their captors. Thus, while other devils stand united as zealots inspired by the will of the archdevils and Asmodeus himself, chortovs serve only because they must, suffering eternally through a second damnation.</p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong><br /> Upon their grotesque creations, most chortovs find themselves stationed on the frontiers of Hell, where they possess innate control over the hellfire that flickers along the infernal realm's brazen ramparts. Their mastery over these infernal flames often sees them recruited away from Avernus, drawn to some of the most dismal forges in the Pit, such as the fortress-cities of Dis and the Burning Legions of Phelgethon, where their titanic strength and rage is harnessed to power the foundries.</p><p>Chortovs rarely work in groups, each arrogant but typically dull-witted brute harboring a vicious hatred for the grotesqueries, ineptitudes, and injustice tormenting others of their kind.</p><p>Should they be forced into close proximity by the orders of their lords, such devils tolerate one another, but are quick to quarrel with their monstrous cousins. While such conflicts never come to blows-the chortovs restricted by their armor from defying the will of Hell-the distraction typically overshadows any benefit gained by their tandem efforts. As such, chortovs typically work alongside diabolical keepers, devils with the desires of Hell and its lords intrinsic to their beings. These minders typically come from the ranks of lesser devils, specifically ordered to direct the ferocious destructive might of these gigantic fiends. Barbazus, erinyes, and-most commonly- imps typically serve as minders of their towering brethren, as even greater devils fear the might of those rare chortovs that manage to escape Hell's control.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Council_of_Thieves.jpg","_id":"FlwSSTYstRGCTRQu"}

Doing so requires an ukobach to make a DC 15 Wisdom check as it impresses its will upon the fire. This DC increases by +5 for every size category of the flame above Small. If an ukobach succeeds, the flame animates with the statistics of a fire elemental of the same size, and follows the ukobach's mental commands. The flames remain animate for a number of rounds equal to the ukobach's Wisdom modifier-usually 3-after which they return to being simple flames, setting the square they cease moving in alight or being extinguished, as their surroundings warrant. Up to five ukobachs can make use of the aid another action to each grant an adjacent ukobach a +2 bonus on this Wisdom check to animate flames (granting a maximum +10 bonus). </p><p><strong>Fire Leap (Su)</strong> As a swift action, an ukobach occupying the same space as a fire, pool of lava, vent of searing steam, or similar blaze can teleport from that burning feature and emerge from another within 100 feet. This ability functions similarly to the spell dimension door, but only between fires. Upon entering a flame, an ukobach is instantly aware of all flames within range through which it might exit. If an ukobach enters a flame and there are no others to exit through within 100 feet, the devil's movement immediately ends and it is stunned for 1 round. </p><p><strong>Firebreathing (Su)</strong> An ukobach can spend a standard action to guzzle a pint of oil, alcohol, or similarly flammable fluid and hold the combustible liquid within its body. At any point within 10 minutes of doing so, the ukobach can expel the liquid either as a 10-foot cone of fire or a 20-foot line of flame, both dealing 3d6 points of fire damage (Reflex DC 13 for half). Upon breathing fire an ukobach cannot make use of this ability again until it drinks another pint of oil. The save DC is Constitution-based. </p><p><strong>Scorch (Su)</strong> An ukobach's touch is searing hot, causing its claws and any metal weapon it grasps to deal an additional 1d4 points of fire damage.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Maniacal and clever, ukobachs embody the tenacity and ever advancing genius of Hell. Legions of these tiny devils labor throughout the it, and from their efforts rise new heresies and tools of depravity. They revel in the fires of Hell and manipulate them not toward destruction, but to the creation of ever greater and more innovative diabolical ends. The keepers of Hell's furnaces, they delight in their mad work, breaking only to torment the damned with their burning tools or newest inventions.</p><p>Ukobachs stand approximately 3-1/2 feet tall and weigh 70 pounds on average. Their fire pokers are fundamentally tied to their beings and disintegrate in a flash of cinders and ash upon the devil's death. These tools hold up to 10 fistsized embers, which an ukobach can fling at its enemies.</p><p><strong>Ecology</strong><br /> Born from the burning depths of Hell, ukobachs find themselves most at home amid the choking and sultry pits where mortals dare not delve, proving well adapted to such stifling environs. While they must breathe, they prove equally well adapted to breathing smoke, cinders, and steam as air. Like all devils, the ukobachs' infernal eyes gaze through even the most stygian night, but unlike their brethren, they dislike the dark. While they harbor no fear of darkness and certainly see its value when tormenting mortals, they view it largely as a waste, seeking to dispel even the most fleeting shadow with an explosion of flame.</p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong><br /> Most ukobachs originate from the flaming canals of Dis or the fiery pits of Phlegethon. Although rarely born from Moloch's crematoriums at the heart of Citadel Ba'al, hordes of ukobach furnace keepers tend the flames of the archdevil's ceremonial ovens. Devastating ukobach engineers also tinker in the foundries at the heart of Phlegethon, creating ingenious devices of intentional or incidental immolation-some infernal rumors claim a particularly insidious ukobach inspired the invention of the first fireworks, leaving these devils with a universal love of such creations.</p><p>On the mortal plane, ukobachs gravitate to cities.</p><p>While many metropolises prove ill prepared to defend against the flames these devils delight in spreading, most ukobachs take more subtle approaches, finding lairs in abandoned smithies, large furnaces, stone ruins, and other places likely to survive the occasional errant flame.</p><p>While indisputably pyromaniacal, ukobachs are more than merely crazed marauders. Seeing a small hovel, pile of leaves, or alley cat burn is nothing to creatures born from the flames of Hell. Rather, they enjoy the order and progression of flames, exalting in striking the spark that ignites a wildfire, upturning the lantern that sets a whole city quarter aflame, or immolating the leader whose death results in the dispersal of a formerly devout congregation. Further satisfying their methodological obsessions, ukobachs prefer setting elaborate traps for their victims over direct combat, often turning whole structures into burning deathtraps, trapping and retrapping the same location, or setting obvious snares that cause their quarries to overlook more devious ambushes.</p><p>These impish devils understand the use of flammable fluids and materials well, often employing barrels of oil, casks of alcohol, heaps of coal, and even alchemical items like tindertwigs in their creations.</p><p>Among diabolists, it is said that all ukobachs know the secret of creating berith, an alchemical element by which any material might be distilled into gold. Stories tell of ukobachs trading knowledge of this element for wild prices or only after an alchemist gathers components from exotic lands. Such tales often offer blatant moral lessons and warnings against these unnatural obsessions, such as the Taldan author and former alchemist Smardina's cryptic and symbol-laden work Shagreen, wherein an obsessed alchemist adventures across the world and ultimately trades an ukobach 23 years of his life, only to find his age and journeys have made his hands too crippled to work-he dies soon after and is dragged to Hell in a golden coffin.</p><p><strong>Summoning Ukobachs</strong><br /> Ukobachs prove unusually congenial when it comes to answering the summons of many diabolists, especially those with an obvious creative streak, interest in alchemy, or queries regarding the inventions of Hell.</p><p>Any diabolist who draws the magic circle necessary to bind an ukobach with mercury or silver powder, or who lights their diabolical summoning with chemical fire rather than normal oil or tinder, increases how difficult an ukobach finds it to escape from the magical trap by +2.</p><p>Additionally, a diabolist gains a +2 bonus on the opposed Charisma check made to obtain an ukobach's service if the task involves creating alchemical or metallurgical works, or otherwise involves fire.</p><p>In addition, ukobachs who know and favor their summoner sometimes bring gifts with them from Hell. While on the surface such boons might seem like blessings, they are always carefully selected by an ukobach and meant to encourage a summoner toward a destructive end.

The construct must make an additional combat maneuver check against its target to reposition it into an advantageous position. If it succeeds, and the victim remains grappled at the beginning of the construct's next round, the ebon acolytus may make use of its sacrifice ability. An ebon acolytus gains a +2 bonus on its CMB for the purposes of making this check if it is adjacent to an altar or similar site of ceremonial bloodletting. </p><p><strong>Sacrifice (Su)</strong> As a full-round action, an ebon acolytus may make a coup de grace attack with its dagger against any target currently grappled into place using its prostration ability. The target is affected by the coup de grace attack and must make a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + damage dealt) or die as normal. If the target is killed by this attack, his soul is sent straight to the plane of the being to which the altar is dedicated, regardless of alignment, and cannot be raised from the dead except by a cleric sworn to the same deity or by a miracle or wish spell. A creature under the effects of a protection from evil spell-or similar spell that opposes the alignment of the god the ebon acolytus is crafted to serve-may be resurrected as normal.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Dedicated to dark gods, fiends hungry for the souls of innocents, and even more monstrous beings, ebon acolyti- sometimes called altar golems-are terrifying constructs, for they are not designed merely to kill, but to aid in the often bloody work required in the service of foul divinities.</p><p>Carved from a single block of stone or other sturdy material, these constructs resemble towering statues, crafted to appear as servants of specific deities and often etched with icons sacred to their worship. In addition to its fearful body, an ebon acolytus is typically crafted with a companion altar, upon which it might aid its master or an unholy congregation in dark rites and ritual bloodletting.</p><p>The exact height and weight of an ebon acolytus varies, largely depending on the shape of its body and the quality of the stone used in its creation, though most rise to around 14 feet tall and weigh around 2,500 pounds. Some carry Large sacrificial weapons other than daggers, but these prove rare and vary between faiths.<strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong><br /> As artificial creations, ebon acolyti have no bodily needs or functions. This allows them to perform well as both grim altar attendants and as defenders of unholy sites. Clandestine cults often go to great lengths to create ebon acolyti just for this reason, as such groups' survivals rely upon the secretiveness of their worship. In some rare instances, especially old and well-used ebon acolyti have been known to defy their creators, but only when such masters have defied the will or tenets of their deity. Religious figures claim such rarities are not a sign of devotion from the constructs themselves, though, but instead a manifestation of a deities' will operating through a convenient medium.<strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong><br /> Altar golems are typically found in places of dark worship, from the expected locations like depraved dungeons and temples consecrated in the name of sinister gods to hidden shrines under the homes of supposedly reputable neighbors or secret mountain hollows. Wherever the perverse will of foul deities takes root, there ebon acolyti might be found.</p><p>An ebon acolytus's most feared ability is its power to sacrifice living creatures to the dark entity to whom it is devoted. This foul capability rises from a series of profane rites conducted as part of the construct's creation, during which it is bound to a specific patron. A ebon acolytus cannot be reconsecrated to a different deity, and those it sacrifices always appear in the same extraplanar realm.</p><p>The being an ebon acolytus is created to serve must be of at least deity-level power, and all attempts to create servants that direct souls to a lesser or more vague source fail.</p><p>Thus, ebon acolyti are typically found dedicated to evil gods, demon lords, archdevils, one of the four horsemen, or similar beings.</p><p>Those killed by an ebon acolytus prove exceedingly diffcult to recover, except by the power of those devoted to the deity to whom the victim was sacrificed. As such, foul priests often employ ebon acolyti to gain bargaining chips, having their construct minion sacrifice a being and demanding some service should the victim's loved ones wish him returned. Alternately, worshipers of notorious deities often face worldly retribution, but might escape tenacious pursuers by sacrificing themselves to their deity, their sacrificial deaths allowing them to forever elude the magic and vengeance of their foes. Occasionally, there are those who seek to track down and reclaim souls wrongfully slain by ebon acolyti. Many quests to unholy realms have been undertaken in the attempt to rescue such damned souls, though few meet with any success.</p><p>Although most discussion of ebon acolyti connects them with foul deities, such need not be the case. Tools first and foremost, these constructs might serve non-evil gods, though in most cases their murderous aptitudes are ill suited to such worship. In some cases, particularly in the instances of exotic and little-known deities who prove both benevolent and bloodthirsty, ebon acolyti might be found in the service of goodly faiths, though such instances are exceedingly rare.</p><p>Construction An ebon acolytus is chiseled from a single block of dark stone, often black granite or marble, jade, or some other lustrous material, and weighing at least 4,000 pounds.</p><p>The stone must be of exceptional quality and costs at least 6,000 gp.</p><p><strong>Ebon Acolytus</strong><br /> CL 11th; Price 24,000 gp CONSTRUCTION Requirements Craft Construct, animate objects, desecrate, trap the soul, creator must be caster level 11th; Skill Craft (sculpting) or Craft (stonemasonry) DC 16; Cost 12,000 gp<br /> <strong>Ebon Acolyti on Golarion</strong><br /> Though rare, ebon acolyti have been found throughout Golarion, consecrated to a host of foul patrons.</p><p>While many watch over temples and holy sites of Rovagug, Lamashtu, and Asmodeus-and peripheral shines to his archdevils-they are more commonly found in squalid holes where demon and daemon worshipers enact their blasphemous ceremonies. Below are two particularly infamous ebon acolyti.</p><p><strong>The Altar of Angazhan:</strong> Deep in the Mwangi Expanse lies an ebon acolytus dedicated to the demon lord Angazhan, the Ravener King and Lord of Apes. Carved from obsidian, the altar resembles Angazhan himself, a brutish ape with savage tusks and six long, slender fingers. Unlike other altar golems, the Altar of Angazhan speaks through the Voice of Angazhan, the animated and endlessly furious skull of a massive gorilla that serves as the construct's head. Although the skull possesses only the intellect of an average ape, it \"leads\" a pack of charau-ka that worships it as their god. The tribe's shamans interpret their lord's will in his endless grunts and howls, directing their people to scour the Expanse for food, riches, and sacrificial victims.</p><p><strong>The Midnight Temple of Egorian:</strong> Found in Cheliax's infernal capital, this massive, marble-carved ebon acolytus is known as the Black Altar. Shaped into the likeness of a humanoid devil with sweeping horns and monstrous wings, the Black Altar seems to be carved straight from the layers of Hell itself. At the stroke of midnight on the first day of every ninth week, nine slaves are sacrificed here to the God Fiend, the Black Altar absorbing their blood and sending their souls screaming to Asmodeus. When the altar prepares to kill its victims, its great wings close so none can see the final blow, and when they open again, nothing of the sacrifice remains.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Council_of_Thieves.jpg","_id":"MN1p517nQ9HbLpwT"}

All creatures within 10 feet must make a DC 20 Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of Constitution damage from the violent choking and necromantic scouring of this supernaturally vile dust.

The lost spell's energy is transferred to Dargentu, who can use the magical energy in one of the following three ways. Dargentu can only store the energy of one spell at a time.  Cast: Dargentu can cast the spell on his turn at caster level 11th. When casting spells in this manner, he ignores the spell's material component requirements, but not its focus requirements.  Eldritch Bolt: Dargentu can release the spell as an eldritch bolt of pure magic energy as a standard action (range 50 ft., ranged touch +12, 1d6 damage per 2 levels of the spell used to create it).  Healing: Dargentu can absorb the spell's energy to heal hit points equal to the spell's level x4. Hit points in excess of his maximum are instead gained as temporary hit points. These temporary hit points last for 1 hour before fading.  </p><p><strong>Spell Sense (Su)</strong> Dargentu can automatically pinpoint the location of any spellcaster within 100 feet who has cast a spell within the previous round. He can also identify spells as they are being cast and all existing spell effects as if he were under the effects of greater arcane sight.</p></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Council_of_Thieves.jpg","_id":"QYDOjFp8Sly7D7AP"}

Called \"phyriphlegeians\" by titans and some of the other elder races of the multiverse, these arrogant and most ancient of giants care only for their own tyrannies, petty schemes made abominable by their masters' scale, strength, and disregard for the survival of all other beings. More than capable of personally ruining most of their own foes physically, Hell gigas prefer campaigns of fear and pain, expending legions of slaves before bringing their own monstrous might to bear upon thoroughly defeated foes-though their rage often provokes them to forgo more satisfying climaxes in favor of immediate destruction.</p><p>The typical Hell gigas stands well over 50 feet tall and weighs upward of 20 tons, in addition to the weight of its armor of bone and metal.<strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p> Exceptionally rare creatures, even on their native plane and compared to others of the waning gigas races, Hell gigas bear the crushing weight of beings that have endured millennia of life in Hell. Most appear as wasted giants bearing the scars of countless skirmishes and hardships, many armored over in half-living suits of exposed muscle, knotty bone, and grisly iron. Even with such second skins, the gigas radiate auras of infernal heat, which, along with their incredible strength, allow them to sculpt stone and iron into grim structures and vicious weapons.<strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p> Most Hell gigas live on the infernal layers of Avernus, Dis (beyond the city), and Phlegethon, keeping to the mountains and masterless expanses beyond the interests of devils and the damned. In some such realms lie the rare, crumbled ruins of fortresses even larger than the gigas' power to craft. Within these ruins and the lavasoaked catacombs below, the Hell gigas make their homes, living as despots apart from others of their kind, ruling over stray fiends, hellspawn, and wayward souls.</p><p>Few Hell gigas care to venture forth from the infernal realm, finding other planes uncomfortably cold. When they do, they universally hold a special hatred for fire giants, loathing the giants yet at the same time delighting in enslaving them and forcing them to do their will.</p><p>Hell gigas attempt to avoid devils as much as possible.</p><p>While a gigas can easily crush most devils, those who slight greater devils or members of the diabolical nobility risk destruction or enslavement by the easily offended lords of Hell.<br /><strong>The First Giants </strong><br />Scholars of the unfathomable eons that mark the immortal tides of extraplanar history have long debated by what means the inhabitants of the Material Plane took their varied-yet in many ways similar-forms.</p><p>Many adhere to the assumption that creator deities designed each mortal race, creating what they deemed as right or desirable in miniature multitudes. Others, however, claim it began with the titans.</p><p>Mighty beings, not unlike gods themselves in many ways, titans possess power beyond most races and a history stretching back before even the oldest mortal races. Although the titan race has diminished, now inhabiting only the most remote corners of Elysium and the Thanatotic realms of the Abyss, their forms have persisted throughout the millennia, and their ancient progeny and myriad inheritors now range where titans once ruled. After ages of life upon the disparate planes of existence, the true titans gave rise to scions imbued with the powers of those strange realms, beings known as gigas, which were less than their progenitors but still mighty beyond reason.</p><p>Distinctive to each realm the titans trod, the gigas rose as servants and emissaries of their lords and ancestors, carving out dominions among the natives of the planes that so shaped them. As countless ages passed and gates opened, allowing passage to the Material Plane, both titans and gigas found their way to new realms.</p><p>While most titans cared little for these small, mundane worlds, the gigas found places where they could, for the first time, be masters in their own right. And as the gigas were born of both titankind and the planes, so were the gigas' spawn, the giants. Within the lands the gigas settled arose new beings, whole races specially adapted to life within their specific environs.</p><p>With the march of countless epochs the titans waned, and so did their children, and their children's children.</p><p>Today, titans remain rare, little-known even among the planes, declining as they suffer from the wounds of an ages-old conflict. The gigas, too, stand distant, removing to the frontiers of realms they once mastered-Hell gigas picking across the ruins of mountain fastnesses, Maelstrom gigas coasting ether storms upon islands of reality, Nirvana gigas crafting and dominating new dominions of dreams, and countless more withdrawing in the face of extinction. Even on the mortal plane, the age of giants has passed on most worlds, with the great beings of ancient times retreating in the face of countless lesser races, devoid of the giants' might yet powerful in numbers. Some draw a connection between humans (as well as some other races) and giants suggestive of a heritage similar to that of giants, gigas, and the titans before them, yet from the limited vantage of mortal lives, few definite corollaries can be made. Perhaps in future eons the truth of such conjecture might make itself apparent to the inheritors of humankind.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Council_of_Thieves.jpg","_id":"SgyFtR2pWyOwk6YC"}

Greater than mere unthinking corpses, like skeletal champions spartoi carry with them some vestige of their past lives and experiences. Yet what sets them apart from lesser undead are their retained caginess and knowledge of tactics, allowing them to function with deadly efficiency in troops of their brethren. Sometimes called the \"sown men,\" spartoi hold a fundamental connection to the near-mythical magical items known as a spartoi seeds, teeth that when planted in the earth summon forth these undead, fully armed and ready for command. Although ancient versions of these items prove especially rare, the well-known nature of their myth has led to dozens of modern versions being created and, with them, a rise in the appearance of spartoi.</p><p>A typical spartolos stands about 5-1/2 to 6-1/2 feet tall, weighing approximately 70 pounds with its full compliment of equipment.</p><p><strong>Ecology</strong><br /> As undead beings, spartoi have no need for food or shelter and have little effect on their environments. Yet despite being obedient undead, all spartoi seem to favor resting as disjoined piles of bones rather than standing corpses.</p><p>Although the undead know no sensations of exertion, spartoi left to their own devices or without commands to do otherwise collapse into scattered remains. Whether such is a matter of tactics and subterfuge or fulfills some other need, the animate corpses give no hint.</p><p>Spartoi detect as being of evil alignment merely because the powers animating them prove fundamentally foul. In some cases, spartoi raised from the corpses of particularly goodly or otherwise forceful individuals might retain the alignment they possessed in life.</p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong><br /> The spartoi are undead skeletons-albeit much more powerful than other versions-designed for war. They have no wants or desires other than to serve their masters, and they carry no fear. Though they have some defense against channeled energy, the spartoi are just as susceptible to divine spellcasters as any other undead.</p><p>All spartoi spring into being with weaponry, typically a spear, buckler, and breastplate, though some rare individuals have been known to arise with more unusual armaments. In such cases, short swords, punching daggers, glaives, and great clubs prove most common. Only the rarest of spartoi have been known to arise brandishing ranged weapons, their undead forms seeming to lack the coordination for such arms. In any case, spartoi weaponry and armor typically bear the markings of ancient cultures, often appearing to be from lands near where the undead (or its spartoi seeds) were created.</p><p>Despite their skill and cooperation in battle, spartoi have little interest in one another. Even spartoi apparently risen from rival nations or cultures seem to forget all past rivalries in death. The mind of a spartolos is a mind possessed by a will to do battle and a skill or instinct seemingly inherent in the bones of great warriors, actual vestiges of personality lingering on only in the rarest cases. Even those spartoi retaining some hint of their former personalities seem interested only in completing their master's will and swiftly returning to their rightful place in death. Such causes many concerned with the necromantic arts to ponder over whether their magic draws forth an actual spirit to its bones, or merely causes a corpse to act with a hint of the personality that was bound to it in life.</p><p><strong>Creating a Spartolos</strong><br /> A spartolos might be created in a number of ways. Most simply, a create undead spell cast by a magic-user of caster level 16 or greater can infuse a dead body with a heroic spirit, resurrecting it as a spartolos. Alternatively, one might seek out rare items known as spartoi seeds.</p><p>Although relatively rare, the oldest seeds might summon forth the corpses of legendary heroes rather than typical spartoi. These slain champions, while possessing the same statistics as normal spartoi in death, possess the ability to speak and often bear great insight into the ways of battle or memories from their lives.</p><p><strong>Mythic Seeds</strong><br /> Numerous myths across Golarion tell of legendary, magical fangs that summon forth the spirits or corpses of powerful warriors. The most pervasive of these tales comes from the ancient myth of the Jiskan hero Strada, though countless variations exist in dozen of cultures across Avistan.</p><p>Legends tell of the mythic hero Strada tasked by the devil Alichino with the impossible charge of besieging an unconquerable city. Seeking out the oracle of Gorum, god of battle, the hero was gifted the thousand fangs of the dragon Kathalphas, who was said to have grown an additional tooth with every champion she had slain. Told to sow these fangs into the dust surrounding the city, the hero praised Gorum and departed graciously.</p><p>Upon reaching the city, he did as the priest had advised, and to his astonishment, the skeletons of the dragon's thousand victims leapt from the ground, clad in all the finery of epic warriors, and arrayed to do battle in Strada's name.</p><p>The unconquerable city fell in an hour, much to the fury of capering Alichino, and for 90 splendorous years Strada ruled as king with an army of the world's greatest warriors ever guarding his palace gates.</p><p>See the spartoi seeds sidebar for rules on using the magical teeth drawn from this myth.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Council_of_Thieves.jpg","_id":"Udm78o4Sn496Nfrl"}

A redcap who successfully saves merely becomes shaken for 1 minute.  </p><p><strong>Red Cap (Su)</strong> A redcap wears a tiny, shapeless woolen hat, dyed over and over with the blood of its victims. While wearing this cap, a redcap gains a +4 bonus on damage rolls and fast healing 3.  These benefits are lost if the cap is removed or destroyed, and caps are not transferable, even between redcaps. A redcap can create a new cap to replace a lost cap with 10 minutes of work, although until the redcap takes a standard action to dip the cap in the blood of a foe the redcap helped to kill, it does not grant its bonuses.</p></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Council_of_Thieves.jpg","_id":"UjoLuIDA0fLcaw9E"}

This effect is not an overwhelming compulsion, but more a subtle suggestion. The save DC is Charisma-based with a -10 penalty.</p><p><strong> Deep Sea Denizen (Ex)</strong> An aspidochelone can travel to extraordinary depths, and has adapted to the intense darkness and water pressure of the deep. It possesses darkvision with a range of 120 ft. and is immune to damage from water pressure.</p><p><strong> Hibernate (Ex)</strong> After gorging itself on innumerable tons of deep sea life and unfortunate travelers, an aspidochelone floats to the surface and goes into a deep hibernation with only its mottled back jutting from the waves. While hibernating, it appears to be little more than a rocky outcropping or, in the cases of the largest aspidochelone, an entire island. A hibernating aspidochelone is considered to have taken 20 on its Stealth check to hide in plain sight as a rock or island. An aspidochelone rouses from its hibernation for one of two reasons: hunger or disturbance. After entering its hibernation, a aspidochelone sleeps for 2d10x10 years, rousing naturally after this time has elapsed. An aspidochelone about to awaken usually sleeps fitfully for the last year of its rest, quivering with tremors that feel like earthquakes to creatures upon it. These tremors are treated as a minor version of the earthquake spell that affects the entire island, forcing creatures on the ground to make a DC 29 Reflex save to avoid falling down and causing 30 points of damage to all structures. An aspidochelone might be awakened immediately if it takes 100 or more points of damage in a single day. If awakened in this manner, an aspidochelone typically dives to escape its attacker, then rises again to consume it. The save DC is Constituiton-based.</p><p><strong> Hibernation of Ages (Ex)</strong> An aspidochelone in hibernation continues to exude its captivating scent. Over time, birds attracted by the aspidochelone's pheromones come to roost on the whale, inadvertently bringing the seeds of small plants and shrubbery to grow in the cracks upon the aspidochelone's thick hide. The preponderance of plants, seabirds, and even other beasts gives the creature the appearance of a rocky but natural island. Thus, any aspidochelone who has spent more than 10 years hibernating gains an addition +10 bonus on its Stealth check to look like a natural island.</p><p><strong> Watery Grave (Ex)</strong> A startled aspidochelone descends rapidly into the depths of the sea, creating an undertow in the water that pulls creatures above the whale down with it. Anyone standing on or swimming within 100 feet of the aspidochelone when it dives must make a DC 29 Reflex save or take 10d6 points of damage from the crushing waves and pressure, and be pulled 100 feet below the water. Even if a creature escapes the undertow, the water within 100 feet of a passing aspidochelone is treated as rough water, requiring a DC 20 Swim check to move at half speed. The save DC is Constitution-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>A legendary creature of the sea, aspidochelones are eldritch whales of titanic size. When floating near the surface of the water, aspidochelones have frequently been mistaken by desperate sailors for small islands due to the craggy, mottled flesh of their steeply humped backs.</p><p>Yet, upon tethering their boats to the whale's tough hide and lighting a fire to ward off the cold, many castaways discover to their horror that the spur of land they have beached upon is in fact an enormous creature. This realization comes too late for many unfortunate souls as the creature plunges beneath the waves, dragging trespassers down with it.</p><p>An aspidochelone appears to be a huge whale with an extraordinarily thick, rock-like hide. From tail to snout, the creature generally measures more than 500 feet in length, and weighs upward of 100,000 tons. Few ever see an aspidochelone for what it actually is, however, having only glimpsed the pitted and uneven skin of its topside.</p><p>As seabirds and other creatures come to rest upon the hibernating creature, they carry with them plant seeds and dirt. Over time, the accumulated plants and wildlife gives an aspidochelone the appearance of a small, densely inhabited island.</p><p><strong>Ecology</strong><br /> Aspidochelones universally live in the deep ocean, as only such large bodies of water can sustain their enormous appetites. Fortunately for seafaring civilizations that rely upon fishing and sea trade for their livelihoods, the gigantic whales are rarely seen.</p><p>Thought by many to be creatures of myth, the incredibly long-lived aspidochelones spend most of their adult lives in extended periods of hibernation. The creatures possess sluggish metabolisms, allowing them to remain dormant for decades at a time as they slowly consume the fat built up during previous feeding frenzies. As they float near the surface of the water, drifting with the oceanic currents, the whales are frequently mistaken for small islands. Even while hibernating, aspidochelones exude an intoxicating pheromone, causing birds and animals such as sea lions to seek them out. While the huge numbers of creatures rarely cause the beasts to rouse from their slumber, foolhardy human explorers or would-be settlers often startle them out of their reveries when they mistake the creatures' skin for rock or clay.</p><p>Even when provoked by humans, aspidochelones seldom remain awake unless stirred by their ferocious hunger.</p><p>When they waken, the whales are wracked by terrible hunger pangs and rampage about the oceans, seeking tons of prey to consume before sinking into their torpor once again. An aspidochelone is a terror during its feeding season, rightfully feared by seagoing civilizations as a monster of the deep come to devour the world. When feeding, the whales consume vast quantities of food, devouring schools of fish, large sea creatures, and sailing vessels alike. Such immense consumption of sea life frequently devastates local ecosystems, wiping out all food sources for dozens of leagues in every direction.</p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong><br /> Aspidochelones do not possess any society to speak of, as they spend most of their time floating aimlessly about the ocean. When two aspidochelones of the opposite gender encounter one another, however, each creature is roused from its hibernation by the other's pheromones. From these unions only one aspidochelone is ever born, and the whales spend 6 months raising the calf to maturity. Once the calf becomes full-grown, the aspidochelones part ways, never to see one another again.</p><p>Among island cultures, a number of myths have sprung up around the creatures. Legends speak of how an irresistible smell lures sailors to remote islands, only to have the entire ship and crew devoured by the titanic whales in a single gulp. A few outlandish myths even claim that the creatures have devoured entire islands, while pirate tales tell of fantastic treasure buried within the hides of beasts like island. Many of these cultures regard aspidochelones as gods of the sea that call men to their deaths.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Council_of_Thieves.jpg","_id":"UuAMmhiYwIy3mnvR"}

As a full-round action, an advodaza can touch a    willing adjacent creature, marking it with a unique symbol similar to an arcane mark. This symbol can be either    visible or invisible, as the devil chooses. For as long as the target possesses the mark, it gains a spell-like    ability it can use once per day. This spell-like ability comes from the advodaza's chosen domain (see the false    divinity ability). The target also gains the ability to telepathically communicate with the advodaza over any    distance as long as the two creatures are on the same plane. An advodaza can mark multiple creatures, up to an    amount equaling its Hit Dice (typically 18). An advodaza can dispel its mark as a standard action, no matter    where the bearer is. It can also, as a standard action, deal pain to a mark bearer that causes 6d6 points of    damage with no saving throw.  An advodaza's mark cannot be removed physically, but a dispel magic or erase    spell that succeeds on a dispel check or caster level check of DC 30 removes the effect.  </p><p><strong>False    Divinity (Su)</strong> Advodazas possess areas of concern as deities do, but on a far smaller scale. Each advodaza    chooses one cleric domain and gains the domain spells (up to 5th level) of that domain as spell-like abilities,    each of which it can use 3 times per day. The advodaza does not gain any of the domain's granted powers. Most    advodazas possess powers from the Evil, Fire, Law, War, or Weather domains, though any domain is possible.  Evil    Domain: align weapon (evil only), dispel good, magic circle against good, protection from good, unholy blight    Fire Domain: burning hands, fire shield, fireball, produce flame, wall of fire Law Domain: align weapon (law    only), dispel chaos, magic circle against chaos, order's wrath, protection from chaos War Domain: divine power,    flame strike, magic vestment, magic weapon, spiritual weapon Weather Domain: call lightning, fog cloud, ice    storm, obscuring mist, sleet storm Idol Armor (Su) Advodazas armor themselves in their fallen idols and    ornaments of devotion. This armor grants an advodaza a +6 armor bonus to AC and immunity to cold, electricity,    and sonic damage, as well as immunity to the spell dismissal. The spells chaos hammer, holy smite, holy word,    and word of chaos destroy this armor, removing the devil's armor bonus to AC and immunities (its cold immunity    decreases to its normal resistance 10). If uninterrupted for 1 hour, an advodaza can summon new armor to replace    its destroyed protection.  </p><p><strong>Infernal Wound (Su)</strong> The damage an advodaza deals with its claws    causes persistent wounds that deal 2d6 points of bleed damage. Bleeding caused in this way is di#cult to    stanch-a DC 30 Heal check stops the damage, and any attempt to heal a creature suffering from an infernal wound    must succeed on a DC 30 caster level check or the spell does not function. Success indicates the healing works    normally and stops all bleed effects.  The Heal check and caster level DC are Constitution-   based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>False gods, fallen demagogues, nemesis devils-the fiends known    collectively as advodazas survive from dark ages past, when mortals offered worship to base things and    unwholesome spirits masqueraded as baleful gods. Although time and faith have turned against these beings, the    most tenacious of their kind have refused to fade into oblivion, and to these obstinate corruptors and one-time    deities the gates of Hell swing wide and welcoming. These lords of cults and masters of forgotten mysteries find    renewed vigor in the depths of the Pit, and those seeking to renew their power and lordship over mortalkind    undergo terrible indoctrinations and binding rites that transform them over the ages into true devils. What    emerge are eidolons of half-remembered demigods, fallen princes seeking to claim their subjects anew, devils of    faith, and fiends of blasphemy- the idol-clad advodazas.</p><p>No two advodazas look exactly alike, each    embodying the powers and concerns that saw it worshiped in ages past and subsequently anthropomorphized as a    monstrous being. Typically, this results in quadrupedal, half-bestial shapes bristling with terrible wings,    hooves, claws, and fangs. Universally, though, they bear the broken remnants of their fallen faith, usually in    the form of cracked idols worn like armor, profane talismans crafted into jewelry, or fearful totems wielded    like massive weapons. Despite their range of appearances, all advodazas possess the same core abilities, though    some particularly ancient or powerful fiends possess unique abilities. Most advodazas stand 18 feet tall and    weigh nearly 9 tons.<strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong><br /> Fantastically old beings, advodazas rose from spirits    worshiped by mortals in distant ages. While humanoids still huddled in crude shelters, begging any power that    would listen for protection from storms, beasts, enemies, hunger, and countless other fears, the spirits of the    land, sky, and animals were the first to give heed. Not deities, but elusive influences, these forces heard    these early prayers and worked what appeared to be miracles in return for sacrifices and adoration. Slowly,    these formless vestiges took shape as idols, fetishes, palladiums, and all manner of cult images. Yet, as    knowledge of true deities and the powers they offered worshipers spread, the old spirits were forgotten or    demonized and rooted out. While most simply faded into the ethers of time, the bitterest demi-deities of    countless worlds found their way to Hell and Asmodeus, who welcomed them and offered them a chance for renewed    power and worship, as well as a chance to avenge themselves against the deities and mortals who had snubbed    them. Honing their hatreds through ages of flame, these beings emerged from the Pit as advodazas. One of the few    breeds of devilkind not forged wholly by Hell itself, advodazas prove exceedingly rare compared to other    fiends.<strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong><br /> All advodazas seek to return to the Material Plane, where they    might tempt new followers to serve, sacrifice, and raise idols to their names. While merciless, advodazas appeal    to many mortal servants due to the directness of their interaction and their willingness to grant power or    violently smite enemies for a seemingly paltry price. In death, however, their servants find no divine realm nor    glory seated beside some grand deity. For when they die, there is only Hell.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Council_of_Thieves.jpg","_id":"YN3wghKNAwAcDOt8"}

The object and lar merge, taking on the statistics of an animated object of the same size (see animated objects in the Pathfinder RPG Bestiary). A lar may possess any object of Tiny to Large size. If the animated object is destroyed or targeted by dispel good, the lar is expelled and takes 1d6 points of damage per size category of the possessed object-1d6 for a Tiny object, 2d6 for a Small object, and so on. The lar is then free to possess another object, if one is available. If a lar is reduced to 0 hit points or fewer, it is banished to its statua for 24 hours, after which it is fully healed. If the lar does not have a statua, or the statua is destroyed while it is at 0 or fewer hit points, the lar is killed. </p><p><strong>Natural Invisibility (Su)</strong> This ability is constant, allowing a lar to remain invisible even when attacking. This ability is inherent and not subject to the invisibility purge spell. </p><p><strong>Statua (Su)</strong> All lares rely on a small stone figure, known as a statua, for survival. This figurine serves as a lar's home, resting place, and tie to the Material Plane. Lares typically rest within their statua, finding it a comfortable place from which to oversee their surroundings. For every round a lar spends doing nothing besides resting within its statua, it regenerates 1 point of damage. However, being separated from the statua for extended periods of time weakens the lar. For every 5 hours a lar remains outside of its statua, it takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage. Only returning to the statua can heal this damage. If a lar falls to 0 hit points, even from nonlethal damage, it is banished back to the Upper Planes. While a lar's statua exists, the connected lar is treated as a native outsider. Any attempt to banish the lar-through dismissal or a similar spell-merely transports the creature back to its statua. If the statua is destroyed, a lar can be dismissed from the Material Plane as normal.</p><p><strong> Suggestion (Sp)</strong> A lar can influence creatures as per the spell suggestion, with some variations, at will. First, to influence a creature in this manner, a lar must occupy the same square as its target. The lar is considered to be able to speak any language and communicate with any creature-even animals and vermin (which are usually immune to mind-affecting effects)-for the purposes of this effect. The target may attempt to resist a lar's suggestion by making a DC 17 Will save. The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Sometimes referred to as \"watchsouls,\" lares are subtle, benevolent spirits that prefer to spend their existence on the Material Plane minding the homes and fortunes of deserving mortals. Kind but aloof, lares watch over their mortal wards and help only when they are most needed. Yet where their homes are intruded upon or their charges imperiled, they prove frighteningly effective guardians, turning everything in their tiny dominions into living weapons.</p><p>Lares are innately invisible, making the nature of their existence something of a mystery. Originating from the Upper Planes, these spirits have no true bodies and appear only as vague spectral eddies to those capable of seeing invisible beings. Yet while their forms prove vague, their blessings are undeniable.</p><p><strong>Ecology</strong><br /> Although formed upon the Upper Planes, lares find themselves drawn to the Material Plane. While some seek out mortal souls to watch over out of some innate sense of protectiveness, others feel a more specific draw, searching out members of specific races, nations, heritages, or families.</p><p>Upon taking up residence in a home of their choosing, what motivates and sustains these benevolent spirits is little understood. They seem to take sustenance from positive emotions, growing weak if left in places with quarrelsome residents or that fall to ruin. Lares never seem to die from negative emotions or abandonment, though, merely biding their time in the hopes that their dwelling might someday again host amenable residents.</p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong><br /> Mortals sharing their home with a lar often create household shrines to them. These tiny sanctuaries, called lararia (singular lararium), serve to house the lar's statuae. Though the lar does not require offerings, many families give them anyway, treating their spirit with reverence. Over time, the lar might become like a member of the family, with the spirit offering advice and taking a keen interest in the raising of children and protection of the home.</p><p>Once a family has been chosen, a lar does not leave its dwelling, not even to follow the family during extended leaves. The only exception to this is if the family takes the statua with them, though this is not a practice lares encourage. Since the statuae are their anchors to the Material Plane, lares are insecure about exposing them to the outside world where they might be lost, stolen, or damaged.</p><p><strong>Summoning a Lar</strong><br /> A tradtion said to have been created and passed down since the days of lost Azlant, many families, homes, and even shops and public buildings along the Inner Sea invite lares to take up residence, seeking the blessings of the divine.</p><p>Few, however, know when their invitations have been accepted, though, as a lar might prove aloof for months or years as it gauges its new wards. In order to welcome such spirits, families construct tiny effigies called statuae in the shapes of honored ancestors, regional heroes, or fanciful creatures, in which the spirits might come and reside. These statuae are non-magical effigies, typically composed of stone or fine wood and anointed with fine lacquers and oils, requiring 2 days, a successful DC 20 Craft check, and 40 gp to create.</p><p>Once created, these Diminuative figures typically have a hardness of 5 and 10 hit points. If destroyed, a statua may be recreated in this same method.</p><p>Summoning a lar is a more elaborate affair, requiring nightly prayers and small offerings of fruit, incense, flowers, and similar gifts to the statuae. For each night one prays to the figure for their home or family's protection there is a cumulative 1% chance a lar hears and turns its attention to the petitioner. This attention doesn't mean that a lar will aid a home, but merely that it has heard the prayer, and it might yet decide that its philosophies and virtues are incompatible with the supplicant. If such is the case, the lar quietly ignores the prayer, and the petitioner's chance to gain a lar's attention resets to 0%, all entirely unknown to the mortal.</p><p>When a lar does accept an invitation, it may immediately plane shift to the associated statua, claiming it as its own.</p><p>A lar typically makes some subtle acknowledgement that it has come, perhaps slightly altering its statua's appearance or lighting candles upon its arrival. It still often takes months, even years, for a lar to become intimate with a family and make its presence actively known, and some never do.</p><p><strong>Lares in Golarion</strong><br /> Lares exhibit extremely variable personalities, and while some prove aloof even after centuries, others become gregarious members of their protected families. Noted here are just two such dichotomous lares rumored to guard sites in Golarion.</p><p>Uncle Penates: When only the members of the Aphinius family of Taldor are present, their home's lar possesses the expensive painting within their drawing room.</p><p>From its hidden statua just behind the painting, the boisterous spirit delights in animating the fine oils to make it appear as though the paunchy and opulently dressed Taldan nobleman pictured is personally relaxing and conversing with the family members nearby. None of the family know the nature of the effect, many believing the house is haunted by the spirit of their ancestor, but none fear or begrudge the presence of kind old Uncle Penates.</p><p>Wolz: This lar has long lingered in the burnt-out ruin of an old stone cottage just east of Windsong Abby in Varisia. His wolfshaped statua having fallen beneath a pile of hearth stones, Wolz subtly watches over any goodly travelers who come to rest in the tiny ruin, lighting a fire, providing water, and warding off danger as if they were his long-lost family.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Council_of_Thieves.jpg","_id":"YZuSdBTBArcYb3Ut"}

Those who fail are blinded for 1d4 rounds, while those who make their saves are dazzled until they spend 1 full round outside the swarm's space. This is a sight-based effect.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Man-eating birds of prey, the rare creatures known as stymphalides stalk the arid plains and coastlines of Golarion in ravenous swarms, shredding warm-blooded animals and unwary travelers with their bladed feathers and dagger-like beaks. From a distance, stymphalides might easily be mistaken for cranes, ibises, or other longnecked birds, though in full sunlight their gleaming feathers and the haze of blood lingering from past meals are impossible to mistake.</p><p>Peculiarly, the feathers and beak of a stymphalides are made of steel, similar to the metallic hide of a gorgon.</p><p>The wings of stymphalides are as sharp as knives and often lacerate their prey as the birds swarm and beat their wings against their unfortunate victims' skin. Similarly, their beaks are supernaturally sharp and can pierce the tough hides of animal prey or the armor of those warriors foolish enough to hunt the creatures. Even if a victim of a stymphalides swarm's frenzied attacks manages to fend off the vicious creatures, the wounds caused by the birds continue to bleed long after being inflicted, and the victim often perishes from loss of blood before ever reaching help.</p><p>Most stymphalides stand approximately 2-1/2 feet tall and weigh little more than 40 pounds. Although mean-tempered and territorial, lone stymphalides prove relatively harmless, thus traveling in swarms of several dozen, relying on strength of numbers to bring down large or dangerous prey. Many tales also tell of enormous breeds of these monstrous birds, powerful enough to prey upon wyverns. These giant stymphalides are said to grow up to 13 feet tall and weigh over 250 pounds, with wingspans reaching upward of 25 feet. Such gigantic stymphalides are rarely seen, preferring to lurk upon desolate cliffs or even amid harsh extraplanar realms.</p><p><strong>Ecology</strong><br /> Unlike vultures and other birds of the deserts and plains, stymphalides do not scavenge carcasses, although they are not above driving away natural scavengers if a large, fresh kill looks particularly inviting. When traveling in flocks, stymphalides prove fearless predators, swooping in and swarming any creature that wanders into their territory. The birds actively hunt their prey, harrying and killing lone individuals or stragglers. The attacks of a stymphalides swarm often prove so vicious that the creatures can take to flight once they have wounded prey, wait for it to bleed to death, and return to pick the corpse clean.</p><p>Stymphalides generally avoid attacking large groups of people, unless the birds have gathered in a particularly sizable flock.</p><p>Stymphalides are not purely carnivorous. A lone stymphalides might resort to eating fruit and other plants if it is separated from its flock or food is scarce, and orchards and fields of crops have been devastated by stymphalides when great swarms of the birds, starving from overpopulation or lack of prey, migrate to new territories. Yet although the birds are omnivorous, they seem to prefer meat. Those plainsfolk or desert-dwellers whose livelihoods depend on livestock have learned to fear the sight of flocks of birds silhouetted against the sky, as herds of cattle and other grazing animals have been ravaged by their swarms.</p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong><br /> Most swarms of stymphalides roost near watering holes, rivers, and coastal cliffs, preying upon unfortunate creatures desperate enough to seek food or water so near to the dangerous birds' nests. The nests of stymphalides are frequently made from the bones of the creatures' prey, piled into macabre ziggurats upon which entire flocks of the birds rest. Particularly large flocks of the birds construct enormous nests, and giant stymphalides can create towers visible for miles.</p><p>When not at rest, flocks of the creatures soar high on warm currents of air, relying upon their keen eyesight to spot suitable prey far below. Because of their voracious appetites, flocks of stymphalides must claim a vast swath of territory to maintain their feeding habits. Stymphalides are fiercely territorial, and flocks of the birds frequently fight with one another in swooping aerial battles to determine possession of land.</p><p>Fortunately for the folk of civilized lands, stymphalides rarely encroach upon areas well traveled by humanoids and other creatures clever enough to bring down one of these metal-winged avians. Among the people of the plains, the metallic birds are often regarded as nearly legendary creatures. Stymphalides breed at an astonishing rate, however, and overpopulation and exhaustion of game frequently force extraordinarily large and deadly groups of the creatures to band together in search of new lands and new prey to devour.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Council_of_Thieves.jpg","_id":"ZaUncYfUS55yEQIn"}

A memory held within a stone idol can be viewed by any creature that comes into mental contact with the construct and by the use of detect thoughts, mind-reading effects, or similar abilities, even one redirected by its stony mind ability.  </p><p><strong>Share Abilities (Su)</strong> An idol can share any spell-like ability that would normally only affect itself (as the caster) with any ally within 5 feet. The idol's creator or allies familiar with its abilities may request the idol grant them specific powers on its turn. Spell-like abilities usable in this way are marked with an asterisk (*).  </p><p><strong>Skills</strong> In addition to the challenge of detecting a stationary idol, these constructs gain a +4 racial bonus on Stealth checks made to hide amid the materials that comprise their bodies.  </p><p><strong>Stony Mind (Su)</strong> Any divination spell targeting a creature or object within 30 feet of a stone idol instead targets the construct. Thus, for the purposes of any spell that reveals auras, those affected are treated as being under the effects of the spell misdirection, while spells like detect thoughts receive nothing more than vague impressions. Should detect thoughts or another mind-reading effect target a stone idol that contains a memory, the ability user instantly gains the memory held within.  </p><p><strong>Suggestive (Su)</strong> Those fascinated by a stone idol's animal trance or hypnotic pattern spell-like ability become highly susceptible to the suggestions of others nearby. Any creature can make a suggestion (as per the spell suggestion) to a fascinated creature, who must then make a DC 15 Will save or proceed to follow the suggestion. Any creature who makes a suggestion is understood by the fascinated creature, as per the spell tongues or speak with animals. A suggestion lasts for 1 hour, even if a creature is no longer being fascinated. A fascinated creature follows only the first suggestion it fails its saving throw against and no additional suggestions. The DC is Charisma-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Rarely seen in civilized lands, stone idols rest among the ruins of ancient civilizations, the sole inheritors of incredible secrets and lost lore.

A gidim's natural weapon damage is modified by its Charisma bonus. </p><p><strong>Dread (Su)</strong> Gidims are adept at using their spell-like abilities to terrifying effect. At will, and while remaining invisible, a gidim can choose to make any of the spell-like abilities noted in its stat block particularly frightening. Any creature that witnesses and is within 10 feet of the effect of one of these spell-like abilities must make a saving throw or be shaken for 1 minute. This effect can potentially increase the severity of other fear effects. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. </p><p><strong>Malevolence (Su)</strong> Once per day, a gidim on the Material Plane can merge its body with another creature's. This ability is similar to a magic jar spell (CL 10th or the devil's HD, whichever is higher), except that it does not require a receptacle. To use this ability, the devil must be adjacent to the target. The target can resist the attack with a successful DC 16 Will save. A creature that successfully saves is immune to that same devil's malevolence for 24 hours. While using this ability, the gidim is not affected by its otherworldly ability. The save DC is Charisma-based. </p><p><strong>Nourished by Negativity (Su)</strong> Gidims seek out volatile mortals to aid them in entering the Material Plane. At the most basic level, negative emotions occur when a creature is dying, raging, or subject to a fear effect. At the GM's discretion, negative emotions might also include non-rules-related effects, such as extreme feelings of anger, betrayal, frustration, hate, or sorrow. Anytime a gidim witnesses a creature affected by negative emotions, it may choose to gain a +1 bonus on its next Will save made to enter the Material Plane, so long as it attempts to enter the plane within 30 feet of that creature and within 24 hours. If within 12 to 24 hours of gaining this bonus the gidim witness the same creature again being affected by negative emotions, it gains an additional +1 bonus on its Will save which stacks with the original and increases the duration of the bonus by an additional 24 hours. Thus, a gidim may gain a stacking +1 bonus to its Will save in this manner once every 12 hours. The devil loses its entire accumulated bonus if it attempts and fails to enter the Material Plane, if 24 hours pass without it witnessing its target creature being affected by negative emotions, or if it takes a bonus from another creature affected by negative emotions. Once on the Material Plane, this bonus applies to a gidim's Will saves made to resist being expelled from the plane. The bonus decreases by 1 every minute until it reaches 0. A gidim that leaves the Material Plane before this bonus reaches 0 retains any remaining bonus.</p><p><strong> Otherworldly (Ex)</strong> Gidims find it difficult to enter the Material Plane. To do so by any means, a lesser possession devil must make a DC 30 Will save, failure meaning it is barred from entry and cannot access the plane again for 12 hours. In addition, after every minute of being on the Material Plane, the devil must make a DC 30 Will save or be expelled, returning to the plane it traveled from. Additionally, as a free action a number of times per day equal to the gidim's Charisma modifier, the devil can empower one of its spell-like abilities to extend out from the Ethereal Plane and affect a target on the Material Plane.</p><p><strong> Sunlight Weakness (Ex)</strong> Gidims' powers are weakened in natural sunlight (not merely a daylight spell), reducing the DCs of their special abilities by -4. In addition, gidims attempting to enter the Material Plane into an area of sunlight take a -4 penalty on their Will save.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Diabolically clever and immortally creative, the legions of Hell use all the tools at their disposal to undermine and corrupt the souls of mortalkind. Among these tools are the souls of unabashedly depraved and hateful mortals sentenced to Hell in punishment for lives of sin.</p><p>The foulest of these souls occasionally find themselves plucked from their torments and reforged in infernal crucibles, etched with bindings of hellish magic, then set loose upon the living. These evil souls bear many of the powers of devils, but fall outside the normal infernal hierarchies, not being considered true devils by their fiendish peers. Rather, they are gidims, Hell-bound souls made weapons of the Pit.</p><p>More than mere souls yet less than fiends, gidims find themselves barred from the mortal plane by the laws of existence. Their minds and memories linger on half-forgotten lives, however, and upon emotions and sensations long lost to fiends. Thus, they endlessly seek ways to infiltrate the paths of the living. Traveling to the Ethereal Plane, they peer into the Material Plane, seeking out hapless mortals and drawing power from their hatred, their violence, their sorrow, and especially their fears.</p><p>Continued feeding upon and encouragement of such emotions grants them greater ability to invade the mortal realm and potentially steal new bodies, through which their foulness might live again.</p><p>Two breeds of gidim exist, lesser possession devils and greater. Both appear nearly identical, but greater possession devils are created from spirits of extraordinary, near-legendary evil beings. These foulest of souls are granted even more powerful diabolical abilities and are often loosed by their infernal masters to torment, unhinge, and ultimately destroy the mortal enemies of Hell.</p><p>Lesser possession devils are typically left to their own devices, using their abilities to sow fear, torment innocents, spread mistrust, and ruin lives.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Council_of_Thieves.jpg","_id":"fcmmq2jr7K7kWYWz"}

At the beginning of each day, it determines an individual to serve as its target and which one of its three vengeances it may make use of that day. It may not change this target or ability until the next day. The target may be any specific creature the salikotal knows of, even if it has not seen its target before. This target is treated as being known to a salikotal for the purposes of using its locate creature ability, even if the devil has never seen its victim before.</p><p><strong> Sneak Attack (Ex)</strong> Anytime a salikotal's opponent is denied his Dexterity bonus to AC, or if a salikotal flanks his opponent, he deals an extra 3d6 points of damage. This ability is just like the rogue's sneak attack and subject to the same limitations. </p><p><strong>Suicide (Su)</strong> As a standard action, a salikotal may target itself with a coup de grace attack. If the salikotal reduces itself to fewer than 0 hit points-or fails to do so but still fails the associated Fortitude save (DC = 10 + damage dealt)-the salikotal erupts in a burst of destructive energy. Any creature within 15 feet of a salikotal that commits suicide is damaged by a blast of metal shards and needle-like scales, taking 6d6 points of damage (DC 17, save for half ). The save DC is Constitution-based. Upon using this ability, a salikotal is permanently destroyed. This effect only takes place if a salikotal willingly ends its own life, not if it is killed by outside effects. </p><p><strong>Vengeance (Su)</strong> While seeking a victim a salikotal prepares itself daily, honing its will to effectively slaughter its intended quarry. On a given day, chosen as part of its contract killer ability, a salikotal may gain the benefit of any one of the following powers, either the one it feels will most aid it or whichever one its summoner requests. Only one of these abilities is active on a given day, and it only comes into effect when a salikotal kills its intended target with a coup de grace. These executions only function on living creatures. Fideicide: The victim's soul is immediately shunted to a infernal prison on Erebus, the third layer of Hell. The soul can be returned to life, but upon casting the spell, the spellcaster attempting the resurrection takes an amount of fire damage equal to 1d6 x the victim's number of Hit Dice, and must make an immediate concentration check (DC 10 + damage delt + spell level) or lose the spell. Necrocide: After 1d4 rounds, the victim's body animates as a zombie under the salikotal's control. The devil may permanently grant control of the zombie to any sentient creature as a free action. Omnicide: The victim's body is utterly destroyed, disintegrating without a trace. Its clothing and possessions remain unharmed. Only spells that do not require a portion of the corpse may return the victim to life.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Prince-killers and assassins of souls, salikotals serve as the bloody chisels by which the lords of Hell subtly shape the mortal world to their whims. Soaring through the night on silent wings, these murderous devils care nothing for life or reason, knowing only a single, murderous goal. Cloaked by shadow and silence, few ever glimpse the sharp features of a salikotal, for Hell's death-dealers reveal themselves only amid the haze of fading life.</p><p>Lean, deft hunters, salikotals move like terrible predatory birds, each taloned step measured, cautious, and full of deadly intent. Protected by an armor of sharp, thin scales, these agile devils universally stand 5 feet, 4 inches tall, and weigh 85 pounds, their barbed frames supporting the breadth of their 8-foot-wide, bat-like wings. They have full control over their slender tails, nimbly manipulating objects and even wielding deadly, Hell-forged blades in these dexterous, prehensile appendages.</p><p><strong>Ecology</strong><br /> Salikotals rise from the tenebrous reaches of Erebus's vaulted heights. Unblinking and endlessly patient, salikotals haunt the claustrophobic upper realms of the lightless labyrinth, stealthy and watchful but caring little for the doings of intruders or their lesser kin. Only the summons of conjurers or the diabolical elite rouse them from their eerie aerial stalkings, drawing them forth from the shadows for a chance to hone their death-dealing expertise in the name of Hell.</p><p>Naturally silent, salikotals never vocalize even the slightest sound, relying on their innate telepathic abilities for communication. Even when using such mental interaction, though, the devils prove terse and resistant to conversation.</p><p>For most summoners, a salikotal's only communication is a slow nod acknowledging its orders, and a nod in answer to the question of its murderous success.</p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong><br /> Salikotals have little to do with others of their kind, be they other salikotals or other lesser devils in general.</p><p>Emotionless and rigid even beyond the typical disciplines of Hell, these assassins realize they exist for but a single reason: to sow death. Their cold precision only wavers when they discuss payment for their most notorious murderous methods, wherein they demand specific types of gemstones in compensation for their grisly work. Few non-devils dare to suppose why salikotals request such precise payments, refusing to work for any other recompense, but among the damned spread rumors of vast vaults filled with glistening jewels, each a fabulous treasure and a representation of a life cut short by the blades of Hell.</p><p><strong>Summoning Salikotals</strong><br /> As in all things, salikotals prove emotionless when it comes to being summoned. They have little reason to purposefully resist or accept a diabolist's call, unless ordered to do so by their infernal masters. Once a salikotal is summoned, though, only murder interests it. Any Charisma check made as part of the spell planar binding to convince a salikotal to undertake a mission other than assassination takes a -2 penalty.</p><p>Once a salikotal has agreed to perform a murder for its summoner, it explains the signature vengeances its kind can inflict upon a victim and offers to exact one upon its summoner's victim for an associated price.</p><p>The devil requests 1,000 gp for every Hit Die its target possesses (intrinsically gauging its victim's prowess), to be paid entirely in one of three types of gemstones: ruby for fideicide, onyx for necrocide, and jacyinth for omnicide. Salikotals prove exceedingly particular in these payments, and if a summoner cannot pay the price in the type of gem requested, the devil refuses to exact one of its vengeances. If the summoner tries to force a salikotal to use one of its vengeances, the devil takes offense and all of the summoner's Charisma-related interactions with it in the future take a -2 penalty.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Council_of_Thieves.jpg","_id":"gK3iGG2bt1xX8hxi"}

An attached gryph is effectively grappling its prey. The gryph loses its Dexterity bonus to AC and has an AC of 11, but holds on with great tenacity and gains a +4 bonus on attack rolls with its bite. Alternatively, an attached gryph can attempt to implant eggs in the target. An attached gryph has a +8 racial bonus to maintain its grapple on a foe once it is attached. An attached gryph can be struck with a weapon or grappled itself-if its prey manages to win a grapple check or Escape Artist check against it, the gryph is removed.</p><p><strong>  Implant Eggs (Ex)</strong> Once per day, a gryph can implant eggs into a helpless target or a target that it is currently attached to as a full-round action by extending an ovipositor from its abdomen and penetrating the victim's flesh by making a successful +4 melee attack. On a hit, the ovipositor inflicts 1 damage and implants 1d4 eggs into the victim's body. As long as a victim has gryph eggs implanted in his body, he is sickened as the eggs draw nutrients from his blood and flesh. The eggs grow swiftly, hatching in a mere 1d4 minutes into ravenous baby gryphs that immediately burrow out of the victim's body. This inflicts 2 points of Constitution damage per baby gryph, after which the hatchlings immediately take wing and fly away.  Treat a gryph hatchling as a bat if statistics are needed.

Inanimate corpses targeted by this attack are instantly turned to stone, but benefit from the perpetual effects of gentle repose while petrified. The spell stone to flesh reverses this effect.

The effect lasts as long as a creature remains within the jade idol's aura.  </p><p><strong>Venom Affinity (Su)</strong> Any poisonous animal or vermin that comes within 10 feet of a jade idol or a creature bearing the idol must make a DC 14 Will save or be charmed as per the spell charm animal. Beasts affected by this effect remain charmed for 10 minutes, obeying either the idol's will or its bearer's.

Jade idols are also particularly valued for their ability to transform living flesh into a stone similar in appearance to jade, but far more brittle and ultimately worthless (a DC 14 Appraise or Knowledge [nature] check reveals the difference). Regardless of the stone's value, the tombs of many forgotten dynasties bear small legions of jade idols, left by their departed masters to keep the residents preserved in lifeless jade for all time.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Council_of_Thieves.jpg","_id":"intUiPwRnGrafK1I"}

It takes a DC 20 Perception check to notice it before it attacks.</p><p><strong> Demolishing Attack (Ex)</strong> A ravener behemoth that makes a full attack against an object or structure deals double damage. </p><p><strong>Mighty Roar (Su)</strong> Every 1d4 rounds, as a standard action, a ravener behemoth can issue a mighty roar in a 60-foot cone that duplicates the effects of greater shout. This attack deals 10d6 points of sonic damage (or 20d6 against exposed brittle or crystalline objects or crystalline creatures). It also causes creatures to be stunned for 1 round and deafened for 4d6 rounds. Creatures exposed to the sonic attack can negate the stunning and halve both the damage and duration of the deafness with a successful Fortitude save (DC 30). The save DC is Constitution-based.</p><p><strong> Rock Hurling (Ex)</strong> Because of their immense hunger, ravener behemoths often ingest ore-laced rocks to fill their stomachs with longer-lasting sustenance. When faced with dangerous opponents outside its reach, a behemoth may regurgitate these rocks and grind them into smaller shards with its hardened teeth. It then spits forth these shards one at a time as boulders weighing between 60 to 80 pounds. A ravener usually carries enough rocks in its stomachs to make up to 4d6 boulders in this manner.</p><p><strong> Shock Wave (Ex)</strong> As a full-round action, a ravener behemoth can hammer the ground with its feet and generate a localized tremor that rips the ground, knocking down smaller creatures and creating di#cult terrain in a 100-foot radius centered on the behemoth. This shock wave lasts for 1 round, during which time creatures in the affected area cannot move or attack. They must also succeed on a DC 38 Reflex save or fall prone. Any spellcaster on the ground must make a Concentration check (DC 20 + spell level) or lose any spell he or she tries to cast. The save DC is Strength-based.</p><p><strong> Swallow Whole (Ex)</strong> A ravener behemoth can swallow a snatched opponent of Huge size or smaller with its bite attack by making a successful grapple check. Once swallowed, a victim suffers 4d6+24 points of bludgeoning damage per round from one of the behemoth's 5 stomachs. A swallowed creature can cut its way out by using a light slashing or piercing weapon to deal 33 points of damage to a stomach (AC 27). Once the creature exits, that stomach regenerates 15 hit points per round. A ravener behemoth may gorge itself upon multiple creatures, shunting each victim to a different stomach each time. Each of a behemoth's 5 stomachs can hold 1 Huge, 4 Large, 16 Medium, 64 Small, 256 Tiny, or over 1,000 Diminutive or smaller creatures.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Ravener behemoths walk the land as the ultimate consumers of all things. This includes every manner of beast, plant, and mineral caught in their path. They indiscriminately fill their five ever-hungry stomachs by cutting wide swaths through tangled jungles, digging through mountains for precious ores, and razing settlements and strongholds to get at those sheltering inside. Sometimes they even ply shallow coastal waters, capsizing ships to feast upon their crews and any other predators drawn by the smell of blood in the water.</p><p>Monstrously massive, a ravener behemoth stands nearly 60 feet tall on four thick, trunk-like legs and measures up to 80 feet long. Multiple horns and tusks sprout from its face and head, helping it root through even the hardest soil and rocks in search of food. It quickly reduces anything stronger into rubble with its earth-shattering roar and stomping feet. A rocky hide grown from the many minerals it routinely consumes protects it from harm even as lichen, small plants, and trees take root along its back, out of reach of its ravenous mouth. Divine blessings bequeathed by the gods ensure only the most powerful spells or adamantine weapons can lay a behemoth low. As a result, the ravener behemoth fears nothing and eats everything.<strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong><br /> Behemoths have existed since the birth of the First World, where they served the gods as work beasts, intelligently shaping and transforming the land to a divine plan.</p><p>However, when such work ended, some gods sought to put down their creations, hunting them to near-extinction.</p><p>Others simply forgot them or left them to die as the First World faded away. But many behemoths stubbornly refused to abandon their life's purpose and crossed into the greater world, migrating in an effort to stay close to their creators.</p><p>Unfortunately, as part of the journey, or because they lost the divine sponsorship of the gods, many behemoths devolved, losing their sentience and becoming nothing more than monstrous animals and creatures of legend.</p><p>The ravener behemoth exists as one such example.</p><p>Driven mad by the inattention of the gods and filled with anger over their abandonment, the raveners found a new purpose. Desperately hungry, these multi-stomached behemoths wholly devoted themselves to feasting upon the bounty of all the gods had created, gorging themselves in an effort to fill the void left by their masters and attract the gods' attention once again. Unfortunately, because of their lowered intelligence, most raveners can no longer answer when such attention finally comes, lacking the will or ability to communicate with their creators, and consumed by an all-encompassing hunger instead. The gods mostly leave such behemoths alone, ashamed and reluctant to fully extinguish their enduring spirits.</p><p>More often, the gods challenge their mortal champions by directing them to deal with such creatures in their stead.<strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong><br /> Most ravener behemoths live solitary lives, as their insatiable appetites cause too much strain on a single ecosystem to support more of their kind. Inevitably, when their paths do cross, two possible outcomes emerge. The beasts either do battle to establish dominance over one another, or every 50 years, certain hormones in female raveners can invoke a natural mating instinct between the behemoths instead. A pregnant ravener may produce up to 1d3 offspring per mating cycle, but it then drives off its mate to ensure enough food remains in the area to raise each cub to young adulthood. Raveners may live up to 1,000 years while food sources remain, and frequently migrate when famine strikes.</p><p><strong>Behemoths of Legend</strong><br /> Some ancient raveners retain a measure of their original sentience, occasionally renewing their relationships with the gods to serve as avatars or guardians. Others choose to remain aloof, pursuing their own goals independent of those who created them. These more potent behemoths sustain themselves through divine rituals learned when they served the gods and passed down from one generation to the next. They use their spell-like abilities to enhance the land and better support their enormous appetites. To replicate these more intelligent and independent raveners, add the following abilities to the standard behemoth. A ravener with these abilities is CR 19 and has Int 14, Wis 18, and Cha 18. It speaks Celestial, Sylvan, and Terran.</p><p><strong>Spell-Like Abilities (CL 15th):</strong> Always active- nondetection; At will-create water, detect animals or plants, purify food and drink, soften earth and stone; 3/day-cure critical wounds, heroes' feast, move earth, plant growth; 1/day- find the path, restoration</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Council_of_Thieves.jpg","_id":"nFTeLNfWrswPQZBu"}

Spending most of its existence perfectly motionless, a stationary idol is indistinguishable from a normal inanimate object. Unless noted in its description, an idol can make use of the majority of its special abilities without moving, though the round after it does so observers can make a DC 25 Perception check to notice minute hints-magical glimmers, minute contortions, etc.-suggesting that the idol is actually animate. Overt actions, such as an idol moving or attacking, make its nature obvious to witnesses, and to others who make a Perception check (as previously noted) even 1 round after it moves.  </p><p><strong>Incombustible Aura (Su)</strong> All creatures within 30 feet of a wood idol gain fire resistance 10. This effect lasts as long as a creature remains within the wood idol's aura. Any time a being makes use of this resistance to any degree, the wood idol takes 1 point of normal damage, appearing more and more charred as it takes damage. This ability ceases to function should a wood idol have only 1 hit point and does not reactivate until it regains hit points.  </p><p><strong>Primeval Curse (Su)</strong> Once per day, a wood idol can force a creature within 15 feet to make a DC 12 Will save or be cursed.  This curse functions similarly to the spell bestow curse, except that it can only either decrease an ability score by -4 or cause a -2 penalty on attack rolls, saves, ability checks, and skill checks. In addition, while affected, the skin of the target takes on a rough, wooden appearance. A wood idol's curse can only affect one creature at a time, and should it curse another creature, the first target is no longer affected. This effect can be removed by remove curse or by eating a goodberry. The save DC is Charisma based.</p><p><strong>  Regeneration (Ex)</strong> A wood idol's regeneration only functions while it is standing on wood, grass, or earth. Fire deals normal damage to a wood idol.  </p><p><strong>Share Abilities (Su)</strong> An idol can share any spell-like ability that would normally only affect itself (as the caster) with any ally within 5 feet. The idol's creator or allies familiar with its abilities may request the idol grant them specific powers on its turn. Spell-like abilities usable in this way are marked with an asterisk (*).  </p><p><strong>Skills</strong> In addition to the challenge of detecting a stationary idol, these constructs gain a +4 racial bonus on Stealth checks made to hide amid the materials that comprise their bodies.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Among rare druidic circles, tribes of the deep jungle, and the mysterious people of the distant west, wood idols frequently serve as representations of powerful spirits of the wilds, who these nature devotees propitiate with sacrifices. The superstitions of strange shamans hold that spirits possess the idols when the sacrifices are made, consuming the offering before returning from whence they came. Yet those who would offend these forces must beware, as they manipulate eldritch powers of the world and might curse one's every effort. While many question the truths of such beliefs, few who impugn the might of such spirits survive the ire of their shaman-creators' devout congregations.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Council_of_Thieves.jpg","_id":"pj3p6Cnm0hPg9XB3"}

A gidim's natural weapon damage is modified by its Charisma bonus. </p><p><strong>Dread (Su)</strong> Gidims are adept at using their spell-like abilities to terrifying effect. At will, and while remaining invisible, a gidim can choose to make any of the spell-like abilities noted in its stat block particularly frightening. Any creature that witnesses and is within 10 feet of the effect of one of these spell-like abilities must make a saving throw or be shaken for 1 minute. This effect can potentially increase the severity of other fear effects. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. </p><p><strong>Malevolence (Su)</strong> Once per day, a gidim on the Material Plane can merge its body with another creature's. This ability is similar to a magic jar spell (CL 10th or the devil's HD, whichever is higher), except that it does not require a receptacle. To use this ability, the devil must be adjacent to the target. The target can resist the attack with a successful DC 16 Will save. A creature that successfully saves is immune to that same devil's malevolence for 24 hours. While using this ability, the gidim is not affected by its otherworldly ability. The save DC is Charisma-based. </p><p><strong>Nourished by Negativity (Su)</strong> Gidims seek out volatile mortals to aid them in entering the Material Plane. At the most basic level, negative emotions occur when a creature is dying, raging, or subject to a fear effect. At the GM's discretion, negative emotions might also include non-rules-related effects, such as extreme feelings of anger, betrayal, frustration, hate, or sorrow. Anytime a gidim witnesses a creature affected by negative emotions, it may choose to gain a +1 bonus on its next Will save made to enter the Material Plane, so long as it attempts to enter the plane within 30 feet of that creature and within 24 hours. If within 12 to 24 hours of gaining this bonus the gidim witness the same creature again being affected by negative emotions, it gains an additional +1 bonus on its Will save which stacks with the original and increases the duration of the bonus by an additional 24 hours. Thus, a gidim may gain a stacking +1 bonus to its Will save in this manner once every 12 hours. The devil loses its entire accumulated bonus if it attempts and fails to enter the Material Plane, if 24 hours pass without it witnessing its target creature being affected by negative emotions, or if it takes a bonus from another creature affected by negative emotions. Once on the Material Plane, this bonus applies to a gidim's Will saves made to resist being expelled from the plane. The bonus decreases by 1 every minute until it reaches 0. A gidim that leaves the Material Plane before this bonus reaches 0 retains any remaining bonus.</p><p><strong> Otherworldly (Ex)</strong> Gidims find it difficult to enter the Material Plane. To do so by any means, a lesser possession devil must make a DC 30 Will save, failure meaning it is barred from entry and cannot access the plane again for 12 hours. In addition, after every minute of being on the Material Plane, the devil must make a DC 30 Will save or be expelled, returning to the plane it traveled from. Additionally, as a free action a number of times per day equal to the gidim's Charisma modifier, the devil can empower one of its spell-like abilities to extend out from the Ethereal Plane and affect a target on the Material Plane.</p><p><strong> Sunlight Weakness (Ex)</strong> Gidims' powers are weakened in natural sunlight (not merely a daylight spell), reducing the DCs of their special abilities by -4. In addition, gidims attempting to enter the Material Plane into an area of sunlight take a -4 penalty on their Will save.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Diabolically clever and immortally creative, the legions of Hell use all the tools at their disposal to undermine and corrupt the souls of mortalkind. Among these tools are the souls of unabashedly depraved and hateful mortals sentenced to Hell in punishment for lives of sin.</p><p>The foulest of these souls occasionally find themselves plucked from their torments and reforged in infernal crucibles, etched with bindings of hellish magic, then set loose upon the living. These evil souls bear many of the powers of devils, but fall outside the normal infernal hierarchies, not being considered true devils by their fiendish peers. Rather, they are gidims, Hell-bound souls made weapons of the Pit.</p><p>More than mere souls yet less than fiends, gidims find themselves barred from the mortal plane by the laws of existence. Their minds and memories linger on half-forgotten lives, however, and upon emotions and sensations long lost to fiends. Thus, they endlessly seek ways to infiltrate the paths of the living. Traveling to the Ethereal Plane, they peer into the Material Plane, seeking out hapless mortals and drawing power from their hatred, their violence, their sorrow, and especially their fears.</p><p>Continued feeding upon and encouragement of such emotions grants them greater ability to invade the mortal realm and potentially steal new bodies, through which their foulness might live again.</p><p>Two breeds of gidim exist, lesser possession devils and greater. Both appear nearly identical, but greater possession devils are created from spirits of extraordinary, near-legendary evil beings. These foulest of souls are granted even more powerful diabolical abilities and are often loosed by their infernal masters to torment, unhinge, and ultimately destroy the mortal enemies of Hell.</p><p>Lesser possession devils are typically left to their own devices, using their abilities to sow fear, torment innocents, spread mistrust, and ruin lives.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Council_of_Thieves.jpg","_id":"q6ao99zckVlIv5A2"}

He also immediately lowers his attacks to parlay if all of the thieves in sight are slain and he's got any wounds at all. If the PCs aren't interested in talking with the Dealer, he tries to flee through the ruined wing of the manor, delaying pursuit where he can with arcane locks on doors as he passes through them. He hopes to emerge on the other side into area E10 after slowing the party down on a chase through the building so he can flee by flying through the alleyways to somewhere he can hide out for the remainder of this adventure's events-in this case, he can become a recurring villain, and can encounter the PCs again in the adventures to come as you see fit.</p></div><hr /><div><p><strong>STATISTICS</strong></p></div><hr /><div><p><strong>Str</strong> 8, <strong>Dex</strong> 16, <strong>Con</strong> 14, <strong>Int</strong> 12, <strong>Wis</strong> 8, <strong>Cha</strong> 18</p><p><strong>Base Atk </strong>+4; <strong>CMB </strong>+2; <strong>CMD </strong>16</p><p><strong>Feats </strong>Arcane Armor Training, Arcane Strike, Combat Casting, Dodge, Eschew Materials, Light Armor Proficiency, Toughness</p><p><strong>Skills </strong>Bluff +17, Fly +13, Knowledge (history) +11, Knowledge (local) +7, Spellcraft +14</p><p><strong>Languages </strong>Common, Elven, Halfling</p><p><strong>SQ </strong>blessing of the Harrow, bloodline arcana, harrow  casting (towers of intelligence and strength)</p><p><strong>Combat Gear </strong><i>wand of invisibility </i>(19 charges), <i>wand of lightning bolt </i>(33 charges); <strong>Other Gear </strong><i><i>+1 leather armor</i></i>, <i><i>+1 punching dagger</i></i>, masterwork daggers (3), <i>ring of protection +1</i>, illuminated Harrow deck worth 250 gp, pouch of gold dust (100 gp)</p></div><hr /><div><p><strong>SPECIAL ABILITIES</strong></p></div><hr /><div><p><strong>Blessing of the Harrow (Ex)</strong> Once per day, Aberten can perform a Harrow reading for himself and all allies within 20 feet-this takes 10 minutes. After the reading, count up the suits that appeared in the reading; whichever suit had the most cards showing grants a +1 bonus to all the affected creatures for 24 hours. The bonuses granted are as follows: Strength (+1 on attack rolls); Dexterity (+1 to AC); Constitution (+1 on weapon damage rolls); Intelligence (+1 on all skill checks); Wisdom (+1 on all saving throws); Charisma (+1 on all caster level checks). All of these bonuses are insight bonuses. If you don't have a Harrow deck, you can simply determine which bonus applies to Aberten and his allies for the day by rolling 1d6.  </p><p><strong>Harrow Casting (Su)</strong> Up to three times a day as he casts a spell, Aberten can draw three cards from his Harrow deck. This adds a somatic component to the spell if it didn't have one already, and also adds a focus component, but does not add to the spell's casting time. For each card from the suit of Intelligence he draws, he gains a +1 bonus on caster level checks made to penetrate spell resistance. For each card from the suit of Strength he draws, the spell he casts deals +1 point of damage per die (provided the spell inflicts damage). Cards from other suits provide no bonuses, and cards that match his alignment grant twice the bonus. These bonuses stack with each other and are insight bonuses. You can randomly determine the suit of a card drawn by rolling 1d6 for each of the abilities; there's a 10% chance that a card drawn is neutral evil.</p></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Council_of_Thieves.jpg","_id":"qHJoDhbmLHxRFQbI"}

Alternatively, the six jinkins can attempt to infuse a magic item with a curse-the nature of the curse is determined randomly. Half the time the curse simply makes the magic item unreliable so that there's a 20% chance each time it's used that it simply doesn't work, but the remainder of the time the curse creates a randomly determined drawback (see page 538 of the <i>Pathfinder RPG Core</i> Rulebook).

As such, all of an uniila's spells (not her spell-like abilities) are strange and terrible to behold. This increases the Spellcraft DC required to identify an uniila's spell as it is being cast by +5. In addition, at will, an uniila can choose to make a spell she casts particularly frightening. Any creature forced to make a saving throw to resist a spell cast by an uniila must make an additional Will save at the same DC or be shaken for 1 round. This effect can potentially increase the severity of other fear effects. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. </p><p><strong>Infernal Arcana (Su)</strong> Once per day, after spending a minute whispering strange formulas and cosmic truths, an uniila can grant an adjacent mortal spellcaster additional profane insight into the ways of magic. This counts as a bonus spell prepared or spell per day of 6th level or lower, which is immediately accessible by the target in addition to all its regular spells. The uniila chooses what spell to grant the target. It need not be a spell already known by the target, though it must be of 6th level or lower and of a level he can cast or from his class's spell list. This spell remains available to the target for 24 hours. The spell can be any arcane or divine spell. An uniila can never use this ability on herself or non-mortal targets. Once a target chooses to make use of this spell, it is cast at the uniila's caster level (typically 8th) and is treated as having the evil subtype. In addition, as the uniila chooses, she may spontaneously add the effects of any metamagic feat to the spell (without the spell being treated as though it were of an increased spell level). Typically, uniilas use this ability to compel magic users to rely on them for more powerful magic, though they might also use effects like Widen Spell to affect unintended targets. </p><p><strong>Scroll Mastery (Su)</strong> All uniilas possess Scribe Scroll as a bonus feat. An uniila is treated as knowing all spells of 6th level or lower in the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook and can create scrolls of any of those spells. Whether an uniila knows rarer magic is decided by the GM. </p><p><strong>Summon Devil (Su)</strong> Once per day, an uniila can attempt to summon 2d4 imps with a 55% chance of success. This ability is the equivalent of a 4th-level spell. </p><p><strong>Witch Token (Su)</strong> By spending an hour in concentration, an uniila can create a token of arcane power. This token may take any form that takes up an item slot, and typically appears as a subtly fiendish ring, amulet, or similar piece of jewelry. While it is worn by a mortal, all of the DCs of any spells the wearer casts increase by +1 (this effect stacks with Spell Focus). However, while wearing a witch token, the bearer takes a -5 penalty on all saves made to resist spells and effects cast by the token's creation. Also, while the token is being worn, the uniila can effectively scry through the token at will and without the wearer's knowledge as long as he remains on the same plane. </p><p><strong>Spells</strong> and effects that typically bar or confound scry also affect the witch token. As a standard action, an uniila can cause her witch token to erupt in a burst of destructive magic that deals 10d6 points of damage to the wearer. An uniila can only ever have one witch token in existence at a time and must destroy a previously created token before creating a new one. The damage of this effect is based on the uniila's Hit Dice. All witch tokens are also under effects similar to magic aura, and are detected as possessing auras of moderate universal magic. Those who use identify or a similar spell must succeed at a DC 20 Will save to receive correct information (that the token sheds an aura of strong divination). Detect evil reveals no aura from a witch token. The saving throw is Charisma-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>The tools devils use to ensnare the minds and ultimately the souls of their victims vary incredibly, from the most blatant of infernal corruptions to enticements that seem not like temptations at all. The elusive cabal devils, or uniilas as they are known by diabolists, employ one of the most seductive drugs in existence in their snares: magic. Mistresses of the arcane with an understanding of the cultic arts-both arcane and divine-that rivals even that of many greater fiends, these mysterious and aloof sages haunt the most ancient ruins and moldering depths of Stygia, the fifth layer of Hell, researching arcana and puzzling over formulae destined to shake the cosmos. When conjured forth or left to their own devices upon the Material Plane, uniilas make no untoward offers or forceful demands of their mortal hosts; they merely offer greater magical power in any of the various ways they might do so. Should the ease with which such might is granted pollute a mortal's ambitions or lead him to rely upon a devil for his power, such ultimately proves the student's fault, not the eager teacher's. So too does the resulting damnation at the end of the mortal's short life prove more of his own doing than any overt diabolical trap, making uniilas' methods all the more sinister for their subtlety.</p><p><strong>Summoning Cabal Devils</strong><br /> Uniilas eagerly seek passage to the Material Plane and as such welcome summons by mortal casters. Whether to experiment with spells, seek out new magic, or corrupt mortals with their knowledge, what plots an uniila holds often prove inscrutable and of secondary interest to a summoner. Tempering their desire to reach the mortal plane, an uniila's vanity prevents it from serving a witless or hopeless summoner. Thus, uniilas turn the act of summoning about on those who call upon them via a planar binding spell, requesting that such mortals demonstrate their spellcasting prowess. If the mortal effectively casts a spell the uniila does not know (not one of those spells she possesses as a sorcerer spell or spell-like ability), or performs a spell of 5th-level or higher, the caster gains a +2 bonus on the opposed Charisma check made to bind the devil. Occasionally, an uniila purposefully remains to serve an inferior spellcaster, or one that fails his opposed Charisma check. Granting the inept tools they should never possess amuses the devils, and even the most incompetent \"masters\" might prove useful in seeking out components of an uniila's ongoing projects in Hell.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Council_of_Thieves.jpg","_id":"rBhHjdU538iTvpQt"}

Brethren to hell hounds, cerberi loathe their distant kin, viciously attacking such hellspawn if not kept at heel by a tyrannical master. Such are the cruel devices of Hell, though, that brazen hatred breeds ingenuity and new evils. Thus, within the depths of the infernal realm, amid the indomitable pits and fortresses of Malbolgia, devils work at nightmarish beast pens, forcibly breeding monstrous hybrids. Born in fury and profanity, Malbolgian cerberi rage forth, ferocious three-headed hell hounds the size of bulls and more than willing and capable of slaughtering their loathed Nessian warhound kindred.</p><p>A typical cerberi stands a broad 4 feet tall and weighs over 200 pounds, while a Malbolgian cerberi can reach over 6 feet in height and weigh upward of 400 pounds.</p><p><strong>Ecology</strong><br /> Denizens of Hell, cerberi embody the ferocity and covetousness of that realm. Bent to service as watch beasts or guardians at the gates of the Pit, cerberi possess unique abilities predisposing them to such grim service. Bearing some measure of mastery over souls and their fundamental ability to shift between planes, these infernal hounds easily trap their victims, preventing them from escaping to the safety of more favorable realms. This ability allows the beasts to prey upon both spirits and the denizens of the outer planes, which every so often attempt to leap between realms to avoid danger.</p><p>Physically, cerberi appear akin to mortal canines, though in truth they hold little in common. As natives of Hell, they resemble devils more than the wolves and hounds of the Material Plane, their fleshless figures and three monstrous heads making this obvious at anything less than extreme distances. Despite the differences in physiology between mortal beasts and these keen hunters of souls, cerberi frequently find themselves treated like unthinking animals-largely due to their inability to speak. Such a mistake often proves deadly, as cerberi possess alert minds and genuine cunning. While most willingly accept the commands of more powerful masters and gory compensations for their efforts, cerberi are intelligent enough to know when they've been slighted and viciously turn on creatures who mistakenly think themselves their masters.</p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong><br /> In their natural infernal environments, cerberi might be found anywhere powerful fiends have need for guardians.</p><p>This makes them frequent fixtures among the dark vaults of Erebus, the estates of Dis, and the fortresses of Avernus. Capable trackers, especially adept at detecting the scent of wayward souls, cerberi also might be found among the legions of the first layer of Hell hunting the freshly arrived damned alongside other devils. Yet, beyond all other tasks, these three-headed hounds excel as captors and minders of the dead, assuring that none of Hell's charges escape their eternal fates.</p><p>Cerberi's incredible ability to trap victims on planes and track the dead make them highly coveted servants across the multiverse. The live markets of Dis teem with cerberi for sale, both ravenous pups and tested hunters.</p><p>Daemons and night hags especially covet cerberi and pay high prices for whole packs of the soul-hunting hounds.</p><p>The hounds' bestial appearances and love of slaughter often cause those who consider themselves cerberi owners to forget the deviousness of their allies, a development that often ends poorly, if not bloodily, for the unwary and the weak.</p><p>Outside of the devil-tamed reaches of Hell and other foul extraplanar wildernesses, small groups of cerberi gather in harsh, pack-like communities. Typically dominated by the strongest or wiliest member, such packs form swift and deadly tides, stalking trespassers upon their vast hunting grounds and doggedly pursuing any scent of lost souls. Although cerberi gain no sustenance from attacking the dead, as befits their infernal nature, all gain a vicious satisfaction at the feeling of an immortal essence discorporating forever within their deadly jaws.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Council_of_Thieves.jpg","_id":"yM8K2P9pitP194dE"}

This affects all creatures with fewer than 8 Hit Dice within a 120-foot burst. Affected creatures must make a DC 16 Will save or become shaken until they move more than 120 feet away from Jezeletrix. Those who successfully save are immune to this attack for 1 minute. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based. </p><p><strong>Baleful Gaze (Su)</strong> Any creature within 60 feet who meets Jezeletrix's gaze must succeed on a DC 16 Fortitude save or take 1d4 points of Strength drain, 1d4 points of Constitution drain, and 1d4 points of Charisma drain. Whatever the result of the saving throw, a creature cannot be affected by the same broken soul's baleful gaze more than once per minute. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p><p><strong> Bardic Knowledge (Ex)</strong> Jezeletrix gains a +4 bonus on all Knowledge checks, and can make Knowledge checks untrained. </p><p><strong>Lay on Hands (Su)</strong> Once per day, Jezeletrix can heal 4d6 points of damage by touch (a standard action, unless she targets herself, in which case it's a swift action). This ability otherwise functions like the paladin's lay on hands ability. </p><p><strong>Torturous Touch (Su)</strong> As a standard action, Jezeletrix can attempt this touch attack. The creature touched must succeed on a DC 16 Fortitude save or take 2d6 points of slashing damage and 1d6 points of Dexterity damage. In addition, the touched creature collapses to the ground in pain, falling prone and writhing on the ground, helpless, for 1d4 rounds. All of these effects are negated with a successful save. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p><p><strong> Tormented (Ex)</strong> Jezeletrix takes a -10 penalty on concentration checks due to her wracking pain. Her wracking pains have also removed her vulpinal calm emotions aura.</p></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Council_of_Thieves.jpg","_id":"zMjbfAX2J3ZHdOc8"}
