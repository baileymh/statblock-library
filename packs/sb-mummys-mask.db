It is here where the strong elemental forces and the massive loss of mortal life used to excavate the earthworks combined to create these terrifying creatures.  Hakotep I drove thousands of slaves to dig the elaborate system of earthworks and deep trenches, and though no one's certain of the site's purpose, some speculate that it is an arcane device constructed to defend against any perceived Shory invasion using their flying cities.  Obelisks bound with elemental spirits were erected throughout the system, and as time crept along, some of these spirits escaped their prisons and fused with the remains of the slaves who once toiled in the trenches. Now, ossumentals act as unintended guardians and caretakers of the site. Those exploring this region have reported that some of the ossumentals maintain the Slave Trenches of Hakotep by keeping the deep trenches clear of the ever-encroaching desert sands, though they are only successful for a matter of time before the winds drive the sand again.  The creatures aren't always active; at rest, their bones lie scattered under the oppressive Osirian sun, waiting for living creatures to wander by before clattering together to attack. An ossumental is a tricky combatant, attacking with its four arms in melee combat and then using its breath weapon to attack multiple targets that are out of reach. It makes use of its discorporate ability to quickly shift position on the battlefield and get behind its attackers.  Fully formed, an ossumental stands approximately 16 feet tall and weighs around 300 pounds.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Mummys_Mask.jpg","_id":"05gCiJ045vEFEcOU"}

If the gorgon has already been defeated, she wastes her action attempting to call it, but this does not expend the bracelet's last charm.</p><p><strong>During Combat </strong>At her first two opportunities to make a full attack, Isatemkhebet activates her burst of vengeance ability. She prefers to leave victims alive but disabled, so that after a fight she can leisurely finish them off with a slam attack and her dust stroke ability, although she does not generally take advantage of this tactic in battle. Each round, she attempts to use her aura of command-speaking in Ancient Osiriani-to order one PC at a time to lay down his weapons, drop to his knees, and take no action. She prefers to attack characters obviously capable of healing or those who provide support to allies first, but if faced with a foe that is particularly capable of damaging her, she concentrates on that target instead. She uses Power Attack until she misses with more than half her attacks made as     a full-attack action, at which point she ceases using Power Attack against that foe.</p><p><strong>Morale </strong>Isatemkhebet is eager to prove her worth to the Sky Pharaoh, and has little interest in surrender, but if the PCs reduce her to 50 or fewer hit points, she attempts to return to her sarcophagus and lower the lid so that she can gain its healing effects (see area A16). Once she's exhausted her sarcophagus's power for the day, she rises again and rejoins the fight until destroyed.</p></div><hr /><div><p><strong>STATISTICS</strong></p></div><hr /><div><p><strong>Str </strong>18, <strong>Dex </strong>15, <strong>Con </strong>-, <strong>Int </strong> 8, <strong>Wis </strong>8, <strong>Cha </strong>22</p><p><strong>Base Atk </strong>+14; <strong>CMB </strong>+20; <strong>CMD </strong>32</p><p><strong>Feats </strong>Double Slice, Exotic Weapon Proficiency (khopesh), Greater Shield Focus, Greater Weapon Focus (khopesh), Greater Weapon Specialization (khopesh), Improved Critical (khopesh), Improved Shield Bash, Iron Will, Lightning Reflexes, Power Attack, Shield Focus, Shield Master, Shield Slam, Toughness, Two-Weapon Fighting, Weapon Focus (khopesh), Weapon Specialization (khopesh)</p><p><strong>Skills </strong>Intimidate +17, Knowledge (history) +4, Linguistics +1, Perception +7, Ride +8</p><p><strong>Languages </strong>Ancient Osiriani, Auran, Necril</p><p><strong>SQ </strong>armor training 3</p><p><strong>Gear </strong><i>skyplate armor</i> (+1 <i>steel lamellar</i>, see page 63), <i>+1 bashing heavy steel shield</i>, <i>+2 khopesh</i>, <i>headband of alluring charisma +4</i>, <i>bracelet of friends</i> (1 charm, currently linked to Kor-Ahn-Tuk)</p></div><hr /><div><p><strong>SPECIAL ABILITIES</strong></p></div><hr /><div><p><strong>Aura of Command (Su)</strong> As long as her statue in area <strong>A4</strong> of the Five-Pointed Sun remains intact, Isatemkhebet possesses an aura of command. All creatures within 60 feet become convinced that Isatemkhebet is a powerful general and feel compelled to follow her orders. Once per round as a swift action, Isatemkhebet can issue a command to any one creature within this area. The targeted creature can resist the compulsion to follow the command (which has the same limitations as a <i>suggestion</i> at CL 14th) with a successful DC 23 Will save. A successful save grants immunity to Isatemkhebet's aura of command for 24 hours. This is a language-dependent, mind-affecting effect. Undead who have fewer than 14 Hit Dice can be affected by Isatemkhebet's aura of command as if they weren't immune to mind-affecting effects.

In many myths and stories, sun falcons act as the eyes of many deities, though most commonly for Ra, who considers these birds to be among his holy creatures on Golarion. Sun falcons seem to watch over important people and oversee noteworthy events-sometimes from far enough away to be mistaken as a star visible during the day, sometimes from close enough to appear as a second sun. Today, the ancient gods are largely forgotten, but sun falcons still gravitate toward Osirion's heroes and pharaohs, suggesting that these abandoned gods are not so distant.  A typical full-grown sun falcon weighs 2 to 3 pounds and measures 18 inches from beak to tail, with a wingspan approaching 5 feet.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Scholars believe that the brilliant plumage of sun falcons wasn't a natural or even a magical evolution so much as it was divine gift, granted by Ra in the first days of these favored birds' existence. Ancient papyrus scrolls and carvings found in ruins claim the ancient gods of Osirion desired a way to inform mortals they were being observed, and so Ra created the first sun falcons from common desert falcons, imbuing them with his power to shine as bright as the desert sun so as to be seen across the land. This divine gift suffuses every feather on their bodies. Individual lost or stolen feathers shed light as a candle for up to 7 days after being detached, and are often in high demand to accent elegant attire for the upper class.  Despite being creatures blessed with the heat of the sun, sun falcons are mortal and require normal sustenance to survive. To avoid reducing their captured prey to unpalatable ash, sun falcons vent gouts of fire from within, slowly lowering their body in temperature to a level that allows them to consume their meals without first incinerating them.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Sun falcons live deep within the deserts of Osirion, though they aren't unknown in Thuvia or even as far west as Rahadoum. They build nests atop rocky outcroppings from gravel, pebbles, and shards of metal capable of withstanding their natural heat, but often abandon their nests only months after creation. How long a particular nest has been inhabited can be identified by the darkness of the rocks it is made from. The stones from particularly well-used nests may even have begun to fuse together from the heat, and are typically lined with crude glass formed from melted desert sand. Some enterprising folk collect these abandoned nests wherever they can be found, and sell them in bazaars throughout the desert lands. But as a typical sun falcon may build dozens if not hundreds of these nests over the course of its life, only the most heavily used or otherwise impressive nests have any real value.  So long as a sun falcon remains in a particular nest, it ranges for hundreds of miles in search of prey, primarily desert rodents and other small birds, though they have occasionally been known to attack much larger prey. When fighting anything larger than itself, it begins the attack by making several passes close overhead, relying on its inborn radiance to scorch and exhaust its prey before diving in for the killing blow.  Sun falcons are only aggressive when hunting or provoked. Most often, this provocation comes from opportunistic profiteers searching for abandoned nests or molted feathers. An aggravated sun falcon takes to the sky, and over the course of several days it might attack everything it sees-stranding travelers, setting caravans ablaze, and even drying up oases in its rage. When fighting, a sun falcon usually opens combat with its blinding flash ability to confound its victim's senses. Following this initial attack, the sun falcon keeps its distance and uses its breath weapon. It then uses Flyby Attack to strafe its target and remain out of the creature's grasp. If its fiery attacks don't seem to affect its victim, the sun falcon disengages from the fight and moves on.  Sun falcons have few natural predators, and they are canny enough to easily avoid most mundane hunters. Their ability to fly protects them from most desert predators, and their natural talents with heat and fire help them fend off any other foolish creatures. The biggest threat to sun falcons comes from efreet who walk the deserts of northern Garund. Immune to many of the sun falcons' attacks, efreet hunt sun falcons for sport as if they were common pheasants, dining on the creatures and using their radiant plumage as decorations on their clothing and armor.  The mating habits of sun falcons have long confounded scholars, as every member of the species ever examined has been a mature female, carrying a single already fertilized egg. Because of the birds' association with Ra, some postulate that these eggs are divinely fertilized, though sun falcons are capable of breeding with males of other falcon species, and the result of these unions is always a baby sun falcon. This method of reproduction creates slight variations in the appearance of offspring, but the creatures' abilities are the same.  A sun falcon lays these eggs on an annual cycle, and each bird has its own cycle. It takes approximately a month for an egg to hatch once it has been laid, and a chick reaches full maturity after only 2 months. Sun falcons are often born already capable of flight. Until the chick matures, it hunts alongside its mother as she teaches the fledgling vital skills. After reaching maturity, the young sun falcon departs into the desert to build its first nest and begin its own cycle.  The only exceptions to this rule are when a sun falcon bonds to another creature. The subject of this bond is typically a humanoid who is suspected to have some great destiny in store. A sun falcon doesn't live with its bonded creature or even have much direct contact, but it keeps nearby, flying above the village or city the person lives in or trailing the person in her travels if she happens to be a desert nomad or leaves her native lands. This bonding process has proven flawed as often as not in the current Age of Lost Omens-though the falcon follows this creature for the remainder of its life, the bonded person is no more likely to have a great future in store for him then might any other. While some skeptics claim that those who believe this legend grant such chosen individuals more chances than they would otherwise receive, artificially inf lating their chance of success, others' beliefs also result in unrealistic expectations that these \"blessed\" individuals constantly fail to meet, which can lead them to instead despair or be rejected by the public.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Mummys_Mask.jpg","_id":"4n9lZEQybQcfU7Q6"}

It monitors the area above it using tremorsense, awaiting a victim's movement into the area. When it detects prey, the shalkeshka can surge to the surface as a standard action and make a single bite attack. This action creates a 30-foot-deep pit where the shalkeshka was laying in wait. All creatures standing in the area above must succeed at a DC 18 Reflex save to jump to safety in the nearest open space to the edge of the newly formed pit. Creatures that fail this Reflex save fall into the pit, taking damage as normal. The pit's walls have a climb DC of 25. The shalkeshka (along with any creature it may have grappled) can stay above ground by making a successful saving throw, or voluntarily fall back into the pit. The save DC is Dexterity-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>A dangerous nuisance in northern Garund, a shalkeshka is a strange burrowing predator that inhabits fertile soil near rivers, oases, and (most destructively) farmland. This creature's anatomy is reminiscent of an insect or some sort of lizard, and when burrowing it tears into the earth with its claws, swimming through sand and soil. Since the creatures spend most of their time buried underground, their pale, nearly transparent skin is cool and clammy to the touch. Shalkeshkas feed on whatever creatures are unfortunate enough to tread the ground above them while they nest in the earth below. When fighting, a shalkeshka viciously grapples its victim with its mandibles, shredding its prey to pieces with its claws.  Squat and powerfully built, a shalkeshka stands only 5 feet tall, but is 8 feet wide and weighs almost 2,500 pounds.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Although shalkeshkas are predators, they have a unique ability to derive nutrition from the ground itself if unable to find prey. This serves the creatures well in the lands of northern Garund, where desert travelers are few and far between and the harsh sun and unforgiving terrain keep roaming fauna to a minimum. While burrowed, a shalkeshka can enter a state of hibernation wherein it can sustain itself by absorbing minerals from the soil. A shalkeshka absorbs nutrients through the tufts of hair distributed across its long body, each of which is capable of leeching valuable sustenance from the very ground. This method of feeding can sustain a shalkeshka for extended periods of time-anywhere from a few hours to weeks, or even years-without the need to hunt. A shalkeshka breaks its hibernation only when it senses prey or during the rare times it succumbs to the urge to reproduce.  A shalkeshka's bristly hairs also serve as one of the creature's sensory organs, allowing it to sense subtle vibrations in the ground. Its compound eyes provide it with excellent vision, and the third eye on the center of its forehead enables it to see in even the darkest of lighting conditions. Its enhanced senses ensure that a shalkeshka remains a constant threat to those who intrude on its territory, regardless of time of day or whether its prey is above or below ground.  A shalkeshka ambushes its prey with impressive speed, bursting from beneath the sand and snatching unwary foes with its mandibles. Once engaged in combat, a shalkeshka fights with unrestrained ferocity. When it encounters groups of prey while hunting, a shalkeshka burrows beneath the ground to stealthily follow them until a member splits off from the group. The shalkeshka then emerges, grabs the straggler, and dives back into the sand to devour its newly acquired meal. If unable to snag its target, a shalkeshka remains above ground until it has subdued or slain its prey. They are powerful creatures, but lack the intelligence to make strong tactical decisions when it comes to engaging a target. However, if the tide of battle turns against a shalkeshka, it doesn't hesitate to burrow away to safety.  Shalkeshkas can live for over 300 years, though most of this time is spent hibernating underground. Shalkeshkas experience periods of fertility only a few times in their lives, during which they lay their eggs in hidden tunnels in the desert. Shalkeshkas stay near their eggs during the yearlong incubation period, sometimes even letting prey pass by untouched in order to conceal the eggs' location. In rare circumstances, however, a pair of shalkeshkas that are both about to lay their eggs will tolerate each other's presence, instinctually recognizing the need for extra defense during the process. Such mutual defenses are dangerous for other intruders in the region, as the two shalkeshkas can then work together to bring down larger prey.  Once the young hatch, they emerge from their leathery eggs in a larval stage that lasts for a year, culminating in a cocoon stage. During their larva stage, shalkeshkas subsist solely on nutrients in the soil as their mature mouthparts have yet to form. Shalkeshkas feel little kinship with their broodmates and soon begin splitting off from the group. As the cocoon stage nears, the parent shalkeshkas leave the area, leaving the young to fend for themselves. Any shalkeshkas still living in close proximity to their broodmates when they reach adulthood often cannibalize their siblings in great burrowing clashes until only one or two shalkeshkas hunt in the immediate vicinity.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Many wandering shalkeshkas travel throughout the great deserts of Osirion, stopping only once they have claimed a lush territory for themselves. Though they can live in the deepest desert, shalkeshkas prefer territory with a source of water, for prey is more plentiful there, and while lying in wait enjoy the abundant nutrients in the soil- the creatures are notorious for setting ambushes near riverbanks or in oases. A single small oasis can sustain a shalkeshka for its entire life.  When adult shalkeshkas encounter each other, violence soon follows. A shalkeshka that has claimed a territory defends it to the death against intruding shalkeshkas seeking to claim it; these vicious fights often leave both opponents injured. Shalkeshkas also frequently battle ankhegs (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</i> 15), as they often share similar environments. Many a caravan has had to alter its path after happening upon a clash between these two burrowing beasts.  These are not the only times a desert caravan must be watchful of shalkeshkas. The creatures grow most aggressive when far from fertile soil, and a train of packed camels and their riders driving across the desert serves as an enticing meal for shalkeshkas in nutrient-poor lands. These attacks inspired the Osirian saying \"claimed by the shalkeshka,\" which is used to describe someone who has gone suddenly missing or a caravan contract that never pans out.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Mummys_Mask.jpg","_id":"76WZVSYgQ4zlQSeH"}

Hanshepsus were originally built to serve as elite soldiers that never tired, didn't need to be fed, and were impervious to common attacks. Using secrets stolen from Jistkan golem crafters, Osirion's own artificers designed hanshepsus to equalize the battlef ield in their clashes against the Jistka Imperium as the two nations carved up northern Garund. Throughout the conf lict, hanshepsus fought in dozens of battles, each time turning the tide in favor of Osirion's forces as they marched ahead of regular, human soldiers through the hot sands of what is now Thuvia. Hanshepsus stand as tall as an adult human. While they appear lean and muscular, their clay bodies give them additional heft, causing them to weigh in at around 300 pounds.   sacrifice of a willing humanoid to provide not only the life force needed to animate the construct's body, but also the creature's intelligence. This allows the hanshepsu to make calculated decisions on the battlefield, and some even commanded humanoid units during battles, implementing clever tactics amid the fray.  Though a hanshepsu is intelligent, it lacks anything approaching a personality. Cold and stoic, hanshepsus don't hold conversations that involve anything more complicated than answering questions or issuing orders. Any attempt to engage a hanshepsu further results in utter silence and an inexpressive face. Some hanshepsus even shut down in the middle of their limited interactions with others, crossing their arms and changing to their solar disk head.  Despite their lack of personality, some hanshepsus retain traces of their mortal memories, and shout out bizarre non sequiturs in the midst of battle. Crumbling texts from the First Age of Osirion contain reports that, after time, hanshepsus became unpredictable, sometimes turning on their commanders and the other soldiers. This suggested that the process of creating these near-impervious soldiers was flawed in some fashion.  Few hanshepsus have been found in the current age, and they are rarely discovered in large numbers. The process of creating hanshepsus was expensive and required a willing sacrif ice, so only the best and brightest warriors were transformed into these constructs. Because of this, modern scholars believe that fewer than 5,000 hanshepsus were created before the practice fell out of favor, and with the march of time, less than 10 percent of that estimation are believed to be still functional.  Hanshepsus work best when assembled in a unit with other hanshepsus. They work in concert, taking physical cues from one another and rarely needing to verbally communicate. When not charged with leading or when fighting alongside a unit containing humanoids, hanshepsus barely regard other creatures. When at rest, they simply wait for new commands. In fighting units, hanshepsus were often at the front lines of a battle, and they used their increased strength and superior defenses to drive a wedge into enemy units and scatter their ranks, allowing the humanoid soldiers behind them to easily pick off the dispersed soldiers.  <br /><strong>Construction</strong><br />  To create a hanshepsu, the crafter must sculpt and shape the body from a single block of clay harvested from the banks of the Asp, the Crook, or the Sphinx. The creature's head must be fired in a specially prepared kiln stoked with 1,500 gp worth of rare desert wood. As a final step, a living humanoid must be sacrificed in order to animate a hanshepsu in a  process that separates the victim's spirit from his body and infuses his essence (but not his personality) into the clay body.  <br /></p><div class=\"heading\"><p class=\"alignleft\">Hanshepsu</p>  <strong>CL</strong> 13th; <strong>Price</strong> 46,500 gp  <br /><hr /><strong>Construction</strong><hr />  <strong>Requirements</strong> Craft Construct, <i>animate object</i>, <i>beast shape III</i>, <i>limited wish</i>, creator must be caster level 13th; <strong>Skill</strong> Craft (sculptures); <strong>Cost</strong> 24,000 gp</div></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Mummys_Mask.jpg","_id":"8IddZPYh0FZVSzOh"}

These social insects leave their nests only to hunt (or defend the nest), often lurking just within the entrance and relying on their tremorsense to detect nearby creatures. When a creature gets too near their nest, the wasps stream out of hiding and attack.  Many varieties of ground wasps are parasitic, and attack large creatures as a means of reproduction, as well as in defense. Ground wasps have a paralytic poison, and once a victim has sustained dozens of stings, its body goes limp. Once its prey is incapacitated, a ground wasp swarm descends on the still-living creature and lays hundreds of eggs just beneath its skin. Some ground wasps swarm for food in a similar fashion. Mature ground wasps don't eat much flesh themselves, but they often take down prey so they can retrieve food for their growing larvae.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Mummys_Mask.jpg","_id":"A0XcnsTPOtAthN6D"}

As a standard action, Ulunat can move over enemies or objects, using its whole body to crush them, dealing 20d6+30 points of damage. Crush attacks are effective only against opponents that are Huge or smaller. This attack affects as many creatures as fit in Ulunat's space. Creatures in the affected area must succeed at a DC 39 Reflex save or be pinned, automatically taking bludgeoning damage during the next round unless Ulunat moves off them. If Ulunat chooses to maintain the pin, it must succeed at a combat maneuver check as normal. Pinned foes take damage from the crush each round if they don't escape. The save DC is Strength-based.  </p><p><strong>Devour Magic (Ex)</strong> Ulunat has the ability to absorb magic directed at it and create arcane feedback that has the potential to shred a spellcaster's mind. Whenever Ulunat is targeted by a spell or spell-like ability, the caster must succeed at a DC 30 Will save or be affected as if he were targeted by <i>phantasmal killer</i>. If Ulunat is in the area of effect of a spell or spell-like ability, the caster must succeed at a DC 30 Will save or be affected as if he were targeted by <i>insanity</i>. The save DC is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Hibernation (Ex)</strong> Ulunat can sleep for centuries and doesn't need to eat during these periods of dormancy, though it eats ravenously and almost constantly once it has been awakened. If Ulunat is forced into an inhospitable environment, it goes into hibernation until conditions are right for it to reawaken. While in hibernation, Ulunat's damage reduction improves to 50/epic and it gains immunity to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance as well as all divination effects.  </p><p><strong>Massive (Ex)</strong> Because of Ulunat's size, uneven ground and other terrain features that form difficult terrain generally pose no significant hindrance to its movement, though forests or settlements are considered difficult terrain. A Huge or smaller creature can move through any square Ulunat occupies, and vice versa. Ulunat can make attacks of opportunity only against foes that are Huge or larger, and can be flanked only by Huge or larger foes. Ulunat gains a bonus for being on higher ground only if its entire space is on higher ground than that of its target. It's possible for a Huge or smaller creature to climb Ulunat with a successful DC 30 Climb check, however unlike the normal rules regarding Ulunat and attacks of opportunity, a Small or larger creature that climbs on Ulunat provokes an attack of opportunity from the monster.  </p><p><strong>Regeneration (Ex)</strong> Like all Spawn of Rovagug, Ulunat is a nearly indestructible force. No form of attack can suppress Ulunat's regeneration-it regenerates even if disintegrated or slain by a death effect. If Ulunat fails a save against an effect that would kill it instantly, it rises from death 3 rounds later with 1 hit point if no further damage is dealt to its remains. It can be banished or otherwise transported as a means to save a region from devastation, but a method to kill Spawn of Rovagug like Ulunat has yet to be discovered.  </p><p><strong>Terrible Claws (Ex)</strong> Ulunat's natural weapons ignore all forms of damage reduction and hardness.  </p><p><strong>Tremor Step (Ex)</strong> Ulunat's thunderous steps shake the ground as it moves. While moving along the ground, any creatures within 100 feet of Ulunat that are also in contact with the ground must succeed at a DC 39 Reflex save or be knocked prone as the beast thunders along. The save DC is Strength-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>The stories from the beginning of the First Age of Osirion claim that Azghaad killed Ulunat-some even say that he achieved this feat with the divine help of Nethys-but the truth is that the Spawn of Rovagug are unkillable. After a lengthy and dangerous battle, Azghaad banished Ulunat to a pocket realm beneath the place where its bloated shell still stands. In this realm, under the oldest and largest settlement in Osirion, Ulunat sleeps.  Before this ancient conf lict, the great beast emerged from the Pit of Gormuz and thundered across Golarion. As Ulunat neared what is now Sothis, cultists of Rovagug channeling the power of raw chaos in a massive ritual- chanting cacophonous praises to the Rough Beast- opened a direct link between Ulunat and Rovagug. Empowered by this divine connection, Ulunat grew to an immense size and charged across the land, trampling everything in its path.  Now, thousands of years later, the Unholy First has begun to stir in its prison. Numerous past attempts to free the Unholy First have failed, and most of these were hidden from the public and Osirion's official history in hopes that the proper method for freeing Ulunat would remain unknown. However, this doesn't stop cultists and doomsayers from trying to bring back the terrible beast.  Bolstered by recently discovered information, a cult of Rovagug has created a key that they know can unlock Ulunat's prison. Using this key, they perform a ritual that breaks open Azghaad's prison and unleashes Festering Ulunat on Osirion once more. Fueled by their chaotic power and Rovagug's fury, the beast erupts from hibernation, destroying everything beneath the Black Dome. Once it reaches the bounds of its ancient carapace, it effectively molts, bursting fully formed from its old shell into Sothis.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Mummys_Mask.jpg","_id":"Ch41Ra6yJNHJMuxw"}

In gratitude, Risen Guards swear to defend the monarch with their renewed lives.

In addition to defending the pharaoh, Risen Guards also look after the throne's household and guests. Thus, an escort of three to 12 guards is likely to be found around any visiting dignitary or Ruby Prince Khemet III's twin younger siblings, Ojan and Jasilia. Both twins are fond of exploring the forgotten wonders of Osirion's desert, and up to six squads of Risen Guards are immediately dispatched to track them down when they slip off on their own to conduct field research.</p><p>Some Risen Guards also collaborate with the city guard of Sothis or safeguard certain interests of national security.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Mummys_Mask.jpg","_id":"EK2suQwI8j8euN7z"}

This ability is otherwise treated a gaze attack. This ability is a mind-affecting illusion (pattern) effect, though vermin are not immune to this effect. The estuarine worm can activate and deactivate this ability as a free action. The save DC is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Seasonal Transformation (Ex)</strong> An estuarine worm has two forms: ahket (wet season) and shemu (dry season). In its shemu form, the estuarine worm is one size category smaller than when it's in its ahket form. Further, its Strength and Dexterity decrease by 8 and it loses its damage reduction. It also loses its guiding star ability and its willful special quality. Its natural armor bonus increases by 8 and it gains DR 15/ bludgeoning. In addition, all of the creature's movement speeds are decreased by 10 feet.  An estuarine worm assumes its shemu form if it goes 24 hours without exposure to water. An estuarine worm that is targeted by a <i>control water</i> (lower water), <i>greater polymorph</i>, <i>flesh to stone</i>, or <i>transmute mud to rock</i> spell immediately shifts to its shemu form (instead of experiencing the spell's normal effect).  An estuarine worm takes on ahket form if it is submerged in water for 24 hours. An estuarine worm that is targeted by a <i>control water</i> (raise water), <i>greater polymorph</i>, <i>stone to flesh</i>, or <i>transmute rock to mud</i> spell immediately shifts to its ahket form (instead of experiencing the spell's normal effect).  </p><p><strong>Willful (Ex)</strong> In ahket form, an estuarine worm gains a +4 competence bonus to Will saves against enchantment spells and effects.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>When Alboras, one of the brightest navigable stars, returns to the night sky, it is a sure sign the River Sphinx will soon flood its banks and replenish the land after the harvest. The inundation also revives the rare but deadly estuarine worms. During the wet season, which is called <i>akhet</i> in Osiriani, the giant worms hunt the flooded plains. When the waters recede and Alboras disappears below the horizon again, the estuarine worms retreat as well. During shemu, the dry season, they enter a semi-torpid state and lie buried beneath the dry soil for protection.  A typical estuarine worm measures 25 feet long and 3 feet wide during the wet season. The worms have a bioluminescent organ atop their heads. At night, the tiny,   flickering light might be mistaken for a star low on the horizon. When the dry season comes, the estuarine worm contracts to become half as long and half as wide. Its skin, once soft and spongy like wet mud, becomes as hard as stone.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Estuarine worms are most active when the River Sphinx is at its highest levels and crests its banks. Though the farmers leave when their lands flood, those who live on the edges of the flood plain, as well as those who sail the river, are still at risk of attack by these predators. Estuarine worms bury themselves in the mud during the day and emerge to hunt at night when it is cooler. The carnivorous worms eat whatever they can find, from fish and frogs, to livestock and people. They have even been known to gorge on crocodiles and hippopotamuses, after which they bury themselves for a time in order to digest their hefty meals. The lights on their heads attract small animals above and below the water, which in turn can attract larger prey. Stories are told of travelers who mistake the light for Alboras and navigate their small riverboats right into the maw of a worm.  As the floods recede, the estuarine worms become less active. When the land above them is no longer underwater, the worms remain buried in the moist soil. For the rest of the year, they live off fat and water stored during the wet season. The worms' flesh contracts, becoming denser in the process. It is commonly believed that the worms, like the soil, harden from dehydration, but it is, in fact, a natural defense mechanism. Though they might seem to be asleep, estuarine worms remain a danger in the dry season. When the worm's resting spot is too shallow or a plow digs too deep, farmers risk disturbing a worm in its hibernation. Though the worms may not be as agile or as hungry during this time, they are still dangerous predators.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Estuarine worms are typically solitary hunters. They reproduce parthenogenetically, and thus have little need for contact with others of their kind. Estuarine worms reproduce rarely, but birth large numbers of offspring when they do. Most of the spawn, however, are eaten by other predators long before they reach full size. When multiple worms are found together (usually because of lower-than-normal floodwater), only the alpha worm uses its bioluminescence. This sign of dominance also keeps potential prey from being drawn to multiple light sources.  Several cults in Osirion keep estuarine worms as sacred beasts in their secret temples. Worshipers of both Lamashtu and Rovagug believe it was their respective god who birthed these worms. Members of the Old Cults revere estuarine worms for their connection to the star Alboras and the Great Old One who supposedly dwells there. The cultists seek out the worms during the season of shemu, when the worms are less violent and more tractable. A combination of brute force and magic are necessary to find, exhume, and contain these elusive creatures. In captivity, estuarine worms can be made to change form regardless of the season through the application or exclusion of water. The high priests of these cults also know certain spells that can trigger an immediate change. The cultists connect to their god through the worms, offering sacrifices to them and reading omens in their violent squirming. The worms serve as guards against intruders, and can also be used as weapons against the cult's enemies.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Mummys_Mask.jpg","_id":"HGPvHopzDLtIedR3"}

Medium and smaller creatures in the area are buried and must begin holding their breath to avoid drowning in the sand. By attempting a Reflex save against the same DC, a creature can avoid being buried if there is an adjacent space outside the area to which it can move; if the save is successful, the creature is moved into an available adjacent space. As a standard action, each buried creature can dig itself out or be dug out by another with a successful DC 15 Strength check.

The save DC is Constitution-based.  </p><p><strong>Sand Blast (Ex)</strong> When in sandstorm form, a living sandstorm can attack with a blast of scouring sand in a 20-foot line.

The save DC is Constitution-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Notorious for appearing suddenly out of the roiling tempests of the deep desert, living sandstorms are capable of turning oases and dry farmlands into areas of featureless desert in a shockingly short span of time. When angered, they can scour a whole army down to bits of shining metal and bone buried under feet of shifting sand over the course of one terrible night. Some Osiriani scholars claim that living sandstorms are related to the deadly khamsin storms that scour the desert, and while these creatures are related to elementals, they have nothing to do with the formation of those iconic storms. Living sandstorms are most comfortable when sand is free to flow across the earth. They become agitated whenever creatures make an effort to remove or limit sand in an area, shelter an area from the drifting dust, or alter the weather to reduce or prevent sandstorms. However, they are curious creatures and enjoy experiencing new interactions with beings of other shapes, and are willing to parley when they believe doing so may open the door to a novel diversion-or if a creature simply appears easy to intimidate.  A living sandstorm in its humanoid shape is about 6 feet tall and weighs 900 pounds. In sandstorm form, it expands its form into a pulsing cloud of streaming, loose sand, which gathers into small clumps before being reabsorbed into the storm.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Living sandstorms are formed from and fed by the unpredictable interaction of raw elemental earth and planar storms or vortices carrying the essence of other planes. These ageless elemental creatures tend to be curious and outgoing when they first discover new places, but are easily frustrated by any kind of restraint. They use their ability to create sand liberally, attempting to pack caves, voids in the Plane of Earth, and other open areas at least half-full of their reddish sand. Because of their origin, they are usually found near gates, portals, and vortices between planes both on the Plane of Earth and on the Material Plane.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Living sandstorms dwell in the rare open caverns on the Plane of Earth. On that plane, they are misfits, feared for their affinities for open spaces and howling winds. When conflicts erupt between the powers of the Elemental Planes, they are sometimes recruited to lead strike teams into other planes, as they are adventurous and enjoy discovering open spaces they can fill with their fine, red sand. They are especially valuable when establishing beachheads on planes that have little in the way of earth, because of their ability to create large amounts of sand in relatively short periods of time.  Due to their intrepidness, they readily answer callings to serve summoners so they can visit new places and spread their sand far and wide. If they see an opportunity to do so, they may break free of their calling and explore the wider Material Plane, where they favor desert climes and their nearby regions, and where they are known to contribute to rapid desertification. When marooned on the Material Plane, they are generally restless until they find a way back to the Plane of Earth, but if they know of a route home, they instead explore the nearby area, wandering farther and farther until they lose interest in filling that world with sand and long to move on to a new one.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Mummys_Mask.jpg","_id":"IdZEWg0gjdgVKKny"}

This organ must either be magically preserved or come from a creature that is alive or has been dead no longer than 3 days. Only one organ may be harvested from each body; all others are destroyed in the process as the tekenu rips the body apart. Each organ consumed grants the tekenu a unique ability listed below. When discovered, a tekenu typically has 1d4 of the following abilities, each corresponding to the most recent organs the creature absorbed. Even when the creature has absorbed all four organs (thus gaining a full suite of abilities), it still hungers for more. The challenge rating of a tekenu that possesses all four canopic organs increases by 1.  <i>Intestines</i>: The tekenu gains the grab ability when using its slam attacks. A tekenu can grapple Medium or smaller creatures with this attack, and it gains a +2 racial bonus on its CMB and to its CMD. In addition, the tekenu gains the constrict ability, dealing 2d6 points of damage.  <i>Liver</i>: The tekenu's slam attacks deal 1d3 points of Constitution damage to any living creature that fails a DC 17 Fortitude save. This is a poison effect, and the save DC is Charisma-based.  <i>Lungs</i>: As a standard action, the tekenu can expel most of the air and moisture from its form, turning into a pile of desiccated viscera. While in this form, the tekenu gains a +8 racial bonus on Stealth checks, and its fly speed increases to 60 feet with good maneuverability. It can revert to its normal form as a free action.  <i>Stomach</i>: The tekenu deals an additional 1d6 points of acid damage with its slam attacks.  </p><p><strong>Odd Anatomy (Ex)</strong> As a collection of various individual organs and flesh, a tekenu is in many ways similar to a swarm. The creature is not subject to critical hits or flanking, and it is immune to any spell or effect that targets a specific number of creatures (including single-target spells such as disintegrate).  </p><p><strong>Vulnerable to Channeled Energy (Ex)</strong> A tekenu takes 150% as much damage as normal from channeled positive energy.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Guardians of long-abandoned tombs, tekenu are the result of a vile practice that instills the discarded piles of flesh left over from the mummification process with an unholy awareness. Separated from the sacred organs placed in canopic jars, tekenus attempt to reconnect with their counterparts among the living by killing creatures so that they can absorb intestines, livers, lungs, and stomachs into their squirming  forms-a process that grants the undead creature additional powers.  Tekenus have been known to hide inside canopic jars collected from excavations (cleverly pulling the lid closed), attacking passersby like a trapdoor spider. Adventurers searching through lost reliquaries and tombs of ancient Osirion commonly call these foul creatures \"gutswarms\"; however, the name scholars give them is derived from an ancient Osirian term for the cast off remains of mummification rituals. A tekenu has an ever-changing form roughly 3 feet long and 2 feet wide, essentially the size of a robust humanoid's torso and abdomen. The mass weighs about 40 pounds.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Scholars debate the genesis of the tekenu. Some propose these atrocities are the creations of sects of evil priests in ancient Osirion, as they have been encountered only in tombs in that nation and of that era. However, several groups claim responsibility for the creation of the tekenu, including modern cults of Kabriri and Urgathoa. More cautious and traditional scholars claim that the tekenu are instead undead abominations resulting from improperly conducted mummification rituals, specifically ones in which the incision to remove organs was performed by a criminal or laborer.  The viscera that constitute a tekenu make it less susceptible to weapon damage and provide it with defensive abilities similar to those of swarms. In fact, until a tekenu absorbs one of the sacred canopic organs, it poses no stronger a threat than that of a swarm of Tiny vermin. The absorption of a sacred organ, however, prompts a radical transformation in the tekenu. Only fresh organs or those preserved by magic enhance the tekenu in this way. Unearthed tekenu have typically consumed one or two organs, normally those belonging to laborers trapped in the tomb at the time it was sealed.  <i>Intestines</i> merge with the discarded remnants to act as long, rope-like appendages, which the tekenu uses to snag and pummel prey. Consuming a liver allows the tekenu to poison its victims and wither their bodies. A set of lungs gives the swarm the ability to hide as a pile of dried gore and increases its mobility. When the tekenu consumes a stomach, its attacks carry a digestive acid to help break down their victims. Of these organs, the tekenu shows particular affinity for absorbing the lungs first, as most adventurers discover a tekenu after being deceived by desiccated viscera they assume to be harmless.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Created in ritual chambers and tombs, most tekenus have no choice of where they are found. Only the most perverse of ancient nobility would have tekenu present  in their final resting places. In the most heinous of cases, tekenu would be stealthily placed into a resting chamber immediately prior to the tomb's sealing. This serves as a final insult to the dead, leaving the undead abomination to break into the holy canopic jars and consume the vital organs within while they were still fresh enough to bestow power. In cases where a tekenu was used as a guardian, a fifth jar was placed inside the tomb to house it.  In some cases, either because the canopic jars were exceptionally sealed or because they were absent altogether, a tekenu may have none of the abilities granted by its canopic consumption ability. Once its tomb prison is breached (by explorers or some natural calamity), the tekenu becomes a roaming hunter, leaving its lair in search of fresh organs to consume. Acting on base instinct, the creature hunts until it successfully absorbs all four required organs. Upon gathering these absent parts, the tekenu then moves back to the tomb of its creation, where it dutifully guards the site from future intruders. Although a tekenu is barely intelligent, it is drawn to the site of its creation, a lingering result of the ritual that created it.  A tekenu has no ability to communicate or interact, and its thoughts, if read by some form of magic, are simple and instinctual. As it preys upon only living and recently dead creatures, it often overlooks constructs and undead. Rare necropolises can be found filled with larger groups of these undead creatures, sealed away in remote chambers or allowed to wander the greater complex unopposed. These groups of tekenus-given stewardships by the priests of Ancient Osirion-ignore other tomb guardians, provided they are not living creatures. These tekenus are set to roam the necropolis consuming small rodents and vermin in the same manner a wizard might use an acidic ooze to dispose of waste.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Mummys_Mask.jpg","_id":"PXVZ9bgm7LIfssA8"}

It is here where the strong elemental forces and the massive loss of mortal life used to excavate the earthworks combined to create these terrifying creatures.  Hakotep I drove thousands of slaves to dig the elaborate system of earthworks and deep trenches, and though no one's certain of the site's purpose, some speculate that it is an arcane device constructed to defend against any perceived Shory invasion using their flying cities.  Obelisks bound with elemental spirits were erected throughout the system, and as time crept along, some of these spirits escaped their prisons and fused with the remains of the slaves who once toiled in the trenches. Now, ossumentals act as unintended guardians and caretakers of the site. Those exploring this region have reported that some of the ossumentals maintain the Slave Trenches of Hakotep by keeping the deep trenches clear of the ever-encroaching desert sands, though they are only successful for a matter of time before the winds drive the sand again.  The creatures aren't always active; at rest, their bones lie scattered under the oppressive Osirian sun, waiting for living creatures to wander by before clattering together to attack. An ossumental is a tricky combatant, attacking with its four arms in melee combat and then using its breath weapon to attack multiple targets that are out of reach. It makes use of its discorporate ability to quickly shift position on the battlefield and get behind its attackers.  Fully formed, an ossumental stands approximately 16 feet tall and weighs around 300 pounds.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Mummys_Mask.jpg","_id":"SEiY1rbJi6FzSSoH"}

Undead within this radius (including the phantasm) gain a +2 profane bonus on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws; they also gain 2 hit points per Hit Die (these adjustments are included in the phantasm's stat block), and the save DC of channeled negative energy increases by 6. This aura can be negated by <i>dispel evil</i>, but a phantasm can reactivate the aura on its turn as a free action. A desecrating aura suppresses and is suppressed by <i>consecrate</i> or <i>hallow</i>; both effects are negated within any overlapping area of effect. When the phantasm is possessing a creature, its aura remains active, emanating from the host.  </p><p><strong>Possession (Su)</strong> Once per round, by making a successful incorporeal touch attack, a phantasm can merge its body with a creature on the Material Plane. This ability is similar to a <i>magic jar</i> spell, except that it doesn't require a receptacle. If the attack succeeds, the phantasm's body vanishes into the opponent's body. The target can resist the attack with a successful DC 23 Will save. A creature that successfully saves is immune to that phantasm's possession ability for 1 day.   A possessing phantasm automatically imposes 1 negative level (from its energy drain ability) each round. A possessed creature can attempt a DC 23 Will save each round to force the phantasm out of its body. If the host succeeds, the phantasm is ejected and cannot attempt to possess the same host for 1 minute. If turned or subjected to a <i>dismissal</i> spell while possessing a host, the phantasm is likewise ejected. The save DCs are Charisma-based.</p></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Mummys_Mask.jpg","_id":"V1uFcXsuSvcYgIcx"}

First, the hermit finds that isolation allows him to more easily experience nature's harsh beauty and raw power, which he seeks to emulate. Second, the wide open spaces provide the hermit with the freedom to experience the world without interference from human society, which is trapped in meaningless competitions to get ahead in a race toward an unhappy death plagued by debt, troublesome relationships, and arbitrary expectations enforced by shame, discrimination, and even violence.  Desert hermits are often defensive and suspicious when interrupted by outsiders. They rarely form druid circles, preferring true isolation. Those who forgo their connection to the desert in favor of a bestial ally tend to select camels, cobras, jackals, and vultures.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Mummys_Mask.jpg","_id":"VmFsLjO1UhFL7c8P"}

Swarms of plague locusts can strip acres of crops bare in an hour, and can depopulate small villages in a day as they move through and devour everything in sight.  Not only do these ravenous pests rend flesh and savage crops, but they also are noted for destroying buildings and other property. Plague locust bites can scour tiles off roofs and weaken the exposed support beams of sheds and stables (to say nothing of what they do to the camels, goats, and horses within). Osirians thank the gods that plague locust swarms are rare and only stream through in large numbers every few years.  Plague locust swarms in other regions are considered to be the work of the demon lord Deskari, especially those found in the northern reaches of Avistan.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Mummys_Mask.jpg","_id":"WuDPwNXYmkEa3Dnp"}

It can maintain this form for no more than 10 minutes before it collapses back into its dusty form. When coalesced, a bonepowder ghoul can manipulate objects and make physical attacks.  </p><p><strong>Dusty Form (Su)</strong> A bonepowder ghoul's normal form is a pile of powdered bone. In this form, it can't make bite attacks, nor can it manipulate objects, but it can cast spells and use spell-like abilities and its other special attacks. The damage it takes from physical attacks is reduced by 50% while it's in its dusty form.  </p><p><strong>Gravedust (Su)</strong> As a standard action once every 3 rounds, a bonepowder ghoul can project a 40-foot cone of grave dust. All creatures in the area must succeed at a DC 24 Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of Strength damage and become infected with ghoul fever (see page 146 of <i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</i>, except that this version of the disease has a DC 24 save to resist it). The bonepowder ghoul gains a temporary bonus to Strength equal to the total points of Strength damage dealt. This bonus lasts for 10 minutes per 5 ability points drained or until the next time the ghoul projects a cone of gravedust. The save DC is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Paralysis (Su)</strong> Those hit by a bonepowder ghoul's physical attacks must succeed at a DC 24 Fortitude save or become paralyzed for 1d4+1 rounds. The save DC is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Whirlwind of Bones (Su)</strong> Once per day as a standard action, a bonepowder ghoul in dusty form can create a small cyclone of whirling teeth and bone fragments. All living creatures within 20 feet of a bonepowder ghoul's whirlwind take 2d12 points of slashing damage (no save) and 1d6 points of Strength drain (Fortitude DC 24 negates). The save DC is Charisma-based.</p></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Mummys_Mask.jpg","_id":"XAHvAycK8F1vLi1J"}

A short length of chain is affixed to the cage, allowing a creature to wield her in combat as an improvised flail; doing so allows Neferekhu to make a free bite against the target on a successful hit. Alternatively, Neferekhu can cast spells while being wielded in this way, but this is considered violent motion while casting.

Although considered craven and foul by humans, jackals are relatively friendly and gentle with members of their own small packs.  Attracted to the edges of human settlements in their territory, jackals often make opportunistic raids on fruit crops and vulnerable domesticated animals. They're also attracted to large deposits of garbage that they can sift through for leftover food. Jackals are remarkably adaptable, and readily forage for insects or fruit, feed on found carcasses, or hunt small or vulnerable game as the opportunity presents itself.  Jackals are notorious for their craftiness in evading pursuit, and they've been known to feign death when caught in order to lull opponents into complacency and gain another chance to escape. A jackal can attempt a Bluff check opposed by its opponent's Sense Motive check to play dead. If successful, after combat ends, the jackal can begin a new encounter with surprise. During the surprise round, only the jackal and any opponents who succeeded on their Sense Motive checks can act.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Mummys_Mask.jpg","_id":"ZxDI54V1JqPzm86a"}

Those who fail are affected by <i>feeblemind</i>. Mekuhare can suppress this ability at will as a free action. This is a mind-affecting effect, and the save DC is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Enigma (Su)</strong> Mekuhare has removed himself from the mundane world to contemplate the mysteries of the universe-and beyond. To facilitate this, he possesses an uncanny ability to elude detection and discovery by those that could possibly interrupt his meditations. Any creature (other than another sphinx), that leaves line of sight of Mekuhare for more than 1 hour must succeed at a DC 27 Will save or be unable to recall details of the encounter, as if the sphinx had cast <i>modify memory</i> to eliminate all recollection of itself. The exact details of this memory loss are decided by   Mekuhare subconsciously during the encounter, and he may eliminate up to an hour of memories. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect and the save DC is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Litany of Riddles (Su)</strong> As a standard action, Mekuhare can telepathically project a befuddling series of riddles, puzzles, and paradoxes at all creatures in a 60-foot cone. Creatures caught in this effect must succeed at a DC 27 Will save or be stunned for 1d4 rounds. Creatures that succeed on their saving throw glean snippets of lore from this brush with the sphinx's mind, granting them a +5 insight bonus on all Knowledge checks for 1 hour and the ability to attempt Knowledge checks with a DC higher than 10 untrained. Once a creature successfully saves against this ability, it can't be affected by Mekuhare's litany of riddles for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting effect and the save DC is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Roar (Su)</strong> Mekuhare can roar up to three times per day as a standard action. Each successive roar has a different effect, depending upon whether it is the first, second, or third of the sphinx's roars for that day. Each of these roars is a sonic effect that fills a 60-foot-radius burst, centered on Mekuhare; the save DCs are Charisma-based. Sphinxes are immune to all of the effects of Mekuhare's roars.  <i>First Roar</i>: Affected creatures become frightened for 2d6 rounds (DC 27 Will negates). This is a mind-affecting fear effect in addition to being a sonic effect.  <i>Second Roar</i>: Affected creatures are paralyzed with fear and deafened for 1d4 rounds (DC 27 Will negates). This is a mind-affecting fear effect in addition to being a sonic effect.  <i>Third Roar</i>: Affected creatures take a 2d4 penalty to Strength for 2d4 rounds and take 2d8 points of sonic damage. Creatures smaller than the sphinx are knocked prone. A DC 27 Fortitude save negates the Strength penalty and being knocked prone. The save DC is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Spells</strong> Mekuhare casts divine spells as a 13th-level cleric. He doesn't gain access to domains or other cleric abilities.  </p><p><strong>Sphinx Monolith (Su)</strong> Mekuhare can enter a state of suspended animation and transform his massive body into a stone monument. This transformation takes 1 minute to complete, during which Mekuhare is immobile. Once he transforms into his monolith form, Mekuhare's body hardens to stone, granting him hardness 30 and 350 hit points. If his stony body is reduced to 0 hit points, it is destroyed and Mekuhare is slain. While transformed, Mekuhare doesn't need to breathe, eat, drink, or sleep. He is aware of his surroundings and can use <i>astral projection</i> at will when in this form. Anytime Mekuhare's body takes damage while he's using <i>astral projection</i>, his astral form immediately becomes aware that he is in danger and can, as a free action, end the <i>astral projection</i> and begin reverting back to his natural form (though the process still takes 1 minute). When Mekuhare ends his transformation, he is immediately <i>heal</i>ed of all hit point damage he may have sustained while transformed. Mekuhare can remain in his sphinx monolith form indefinitely.</p></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Mummys_Mask.jpg","_id":"auicPMqPPvX3FikX"}

The majority of these golems were created during the First Age in Osirion, though evidence of their existence has turned up beyond the nation's borders. A panthereon stands over 8 feet tall and weighs 600 pounds. While its sculpted form may vary, it is typically muscular and wears no clothing save for a simple Osirian skirt.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Osirion's golem makers dispute the notion that the panthereon's design was simply the work of some arcane crafter. Instead, many of them believe the inspiration for its creation was bestowed by the ancient gods themselves. The design for golems has changed little from their initial creation in the First Age, and most variations only came along during the end of the Second Age.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  As mindless constructs, panthereons have no society or culture of their own. Scholars closely associate panthereons with the societal norms of Osirion during the period when the creatures were widely used as tomb guardians. Many panthereons have abilities tied to their creators, but most of these creators have long since perished, leaving the golems to act on their last given orders.  <br /><strong>Construction</strong><br />  A panthereon's body is carved from 1,000 pounds of clay mixed with the powdered bones of a purebred Osiriani cat that was either awakened or served as a bonded familiar. During the sculpting process the creator may only moisten the clay with water sourced from an Osirian desert oasis and must add 1,500 gp worth of rare oils and powders.  <br /></p><div class=\"heading\"><p class=\"alignleft\">Panthereon</p>  <strong>CL</strong> 11th; <strong>Price</strong> 48,500 gp  <br /><hr /><strong>Construction</strong><hr />  <strong>Requirements</strong> Craft Construct, <i>animate objects</i>, <i>bless</i>, <i>commune</i>, <i>prayer</i>, <i>resurrection</i>, <i>searing light</i>, <i>true seeing</i>, creator must be caster level 11th; <strong>Skill</strong> Craft (pottery) or Craft (sculpture) DC 16; <strong>Cost</strong> 28,500 gp   <br /><strong>VARIANT PANTHEREONS</strong><br />  While most panthereons possess the statistics presented above, a few of Osirion's finest golem makers have developed specialized panthereons, each with slightly different enhancements to their abilities. Each one of these variants lists the new abilities, as well as any additional construction requirements and the additional cost in special materials required to create the variant.  <br /><strong>Esteemed (CR+0)</strong>  The ultimate palace guard, an esteemed panthereon can take the form of a black house cat (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</i> 131) at will as a standard action. This allows the panthereon to guard a location without being seen as an obvious sentry. Esteemed panthereons can be commanded to change between house cat and guardian forms by their creator, or they can be made to do so under set conditions. Though not widely held, the superstitious belief that any house cat could be a disguised esteemed panthereon has led some to keep cats as a deterrent to thieves and vandals.  <br /><strong>Additional Construction</strong> <strong>Requirements</strong>: <i>beast shape II</i>; <strong>Additional Cost</strong>: 21,000 gp.  <br /><strong>Slaver (CR+0)</strong><br />  The slaver panthereon was initially designed to supervise recalcitrant slaves, but it has since proved equally useful when hunting anyone the golem's creator wants to have captured alive. Because slaves and prisoners are often a very valuable commodity, the slaver panthereon has the ability to, as a swift action, convert all of its attacks to nonlethal damage. When it does so, its slam attacks also gain the grab special ability. As another swift action, it can change its attacks back to dealing normal lethal damage (losing the grab ability in the process). Since they are nonintelligent, slaver panthereons default to dealing nonlethal damage unless their master orders otherwise.   <br /><strong>Additional ConstructionRequirements</strong>: Merciful Spell; <strong>Additional Cost</strong>: 21,500 gp.  <br /><strong>Spell Bearer (CR+1)</strong><br />  This panthereon serves its master by augmenting and reinforcing the master's spellcasting. Some sages believe the spell bearer panthereon was a precursor to the present-day shield guardian golem. A spell bearer panthereon can store a single spell of 1st through 6th level, but the golem can't be commanded to cast the spell as a shield guardian golem would. Instead, should that spell be cast on the golem or its creator (as long as the creator is within 60 feet), the spell is immediately countered, as by counterspell, requiring no action of the panthereon or its creator. Once used, the spell in the panthereon is gone, and a new spell (or the same spell) may be placed into it.  In addition, if a spell bearer panthereon's creator casts a spell within 60 feet of the panthereon, the golem may mirror its creator, and also cast the same spell the following round. A spell bearer panthereon can use this ability once per day for any spell 3rd-level or lower.  <br /><strong>Additional Construction Requirements</strong>: Improved Counterspell, <i>mnemonic enhancer</i>; <strong>Additional Cost</strong>: 30,000 gp.  <br /><strong>TrueHunter (CR+1)</strong><br />  During creation, this panthereon is given the name of an individual it is tasked with slaying. The target's identity must be clear and unambiguous. Once the ritual is complete and the panthereon is activated, the golem receives a +4 bonus on attacks against its named target and deals it an extra 2d6 points of damage. This additional damage is not multiplied on a critical hit. A true hunter can always detect the presence and location of its target so long as the target is within 1 mile.  If the true hunter's target is killed, it becomes a regular panthereon. If the target is resurrected or reincarnated, the true hunter instinctively becomes aware of this, and regains all of its old abilities. It can't pinpoint their direction or presence unless the target is within 1 mile.  <br /><strong>Additional Construction Requirements</strong>: <i>instant enemy</i>; <strong>Additional Cost</strong>: 26,500 gp.</div></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Mummys_Mask.jpg","_id":"dRFDmYuPCB1aeQgF"}

This condition lasts until the egg hatches 1d6 days later, at which point the larvae consume most of the host, killing it.

They keep to their shallow burrows during the hottest parts of the day, but remain near the opening to ambush creatures that wander near. A fully-grown ground wasp is 2 feet long, with a wingspan of 5 feet, and weighs 22 pounds.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Mummys_Mask.jpg","_id":"du98NWNY3wYnaBC0"}

Its Strength score is reduced to 1, but its ability scores are otherwise unchanged. A living sandstorm remains in one form until it chooses to assume its other form. A change in form can't be dispelled, nor does the living sandstorm revert to any particular form when killed (both shapes are its true form). A <i>true seeing</i> spell reveals both forms simultaneously.  </p><p><strong>Sandsight (Ex)</strong> The living sandstorm can see through sand, dust, and other particles in the air as if the air were clear, ignoring the miss chance for these obstructions, up to its normal range of vision.  </p><p><strong>Slashing Sand (Ex)</strong> A living sandstorm's swarm attack deals slashing damage. Its slam attacks deal bludgeoning and slashing damage.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Notorious for appearing suddenly out of the roiling tempests of the deep desert, living sandstorms are capable of turning oases and dry farmlands into areas of featureless desert in a shockingly short span of time. When angered, they can scour a whole army down to bits of shining metal and bone buried under feet of shifting sand over the course of one terrible night. Some Osiriani scholars claim that living sandstorms are related to the deadly khamsin storms that scour the desert, and while these creatures are related to elementals, they have nothing to do with the formation of those iconic storms. Living sandstorms are most comfortable when sand is free to flow across the earth. They become agitated whenever creatures make an effort to remove or limit sand in an area, shelter an area from the drifting dust, or alter the weather to reduce or prevent sandstorms. However, they are curious creatures and enjoy experiencing new interactions with beings of other shapes, and are willing to parley when they believe doing so may open the door to a novel diversion-or if a creature simply appears easy to intimidate.  A living sandstorm in its humanoid shape is about 6 feet tall and weighs 900 pounds. In sandstorm form, it expands its form into a pulsing cloud of streaming, loose sand, which gathers into small clumps before being reabsorbed into the storm.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Living sandstorms are formed from and fed by the unpredictable interaction of raw elemental earth and planar storms or vortices carrying the essence of other planes. These ageless elemental creatures tend to be curious and outgoing when they first discover new places, but are easily frustrated by any kind of restraint. They use their ability to create sand liberally, attempting to pack caves, voids in the Plane of Earth, and other open areas at least half-full of their reddish sand. Because of their origin, they are usually found near gates, portals, and vortices between planes both on the Plane of Earth and on the Material Plane.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Living sandstorms dwell in the rare open caverns on the Plane of Earth. On that plane, they are misfits, feared for their affinities for open spaces and howling winds. When conflicts erupt between the powers of the Elemental Planes, they are sometimes recruited to lead strike teams into other planes, as they are adventurous and enjoy discovering open spaces they can fill with their fine, red sand. They are especially valuable when establishing beachheads on planes that have little in the way of earth, because of their ability to create large amounts of sand in relatively short periods of time.  Due to their intrepidness, they readily answer callings to serve summoners so they can visit new places and spread their sand far and wide. If they see an opportunity to do so, they may break free of their calling and explore the wider Material Plane, where they favor desert climes and their nearby regions, and where they are known to contribute to rapid desertification. When marooned on the Material Plane, they are generally restless until they find a way back to the Plane of Earth, but if they know of a route home, they instead explore the nearby area, wandering farther and farther until they lose interest in filling that world with sand and long to move on to a new one.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Mummys_Mask.jpg","_id":"eqCUrSKHDuHWV9H6"}

The gypsosphinx gains a +4 bonus on this check if both additional claw attacks hit.  </p><p><strong>Mystic Sight (Su)</strong> A gypsosphinx sees death coming and can often foretell the manner of a person's death. A gypsosphinx frequently uses this power to threaten creatures, but it can also use the ability to grant warnings to some. To use either version of this ability, the gypsosphinx must concentrate on the targeted creature for 1 round, after which it speaks a short, usually cryptic phrase that alludes to a likely future death for the creature in question. The threat or warning must be issued verbally to the target within 1 round of   this concentration period, and the target must be within 30 feet for the effects to occur. A creature can negate the effects granted by the threat or warning (see below) with a successful DC 25 Will save. When a gypsosphinx issues a threat or warning, you should frame it in vague terms but be explicit enough that the proclamation can be interpreted as a specific and possible deadly event-use what you know is coming in the creature's future, based on yet-to-occur events in the campaign, to narrow in on possible deaths that may exist. A gypsosphinx is fond of issuing veiled (or outright blatant) threats to creatures who know it possesses mystic sight, even when the sphinx hasn't actually used the power to foretell a possible future death-in these cases, you need not link the threat or warning to likely future events and can make up whatever you wish, since neither has actual supernatural weight behind the words. Issuing a trick or warning is a language-dependent curse effect. The save DC is Wisdom-based.  <i>Threat</i>: If a gypsosphinx issues a threat, an affected target becomes convinced that death awaits in that form; the next time the victim is confronted with something that could be interpreted as being the predicted deadly threat, it becomes staggered with fear as long as the threat persists. If the victim survives this threat alive, it may attempt a new DC 25 Will save to end the effect; otherwise, the threat persists until the next time such an event comes to pass. A threat is a fear effect.  <i>Warning</i>: If a gypsosphinx issues a warning, an affected target mentally prepares to face death in that form; the next time the victim is confronted with something that could be interpreted as being the predicted deadly threat, it gains a +4 morale bonus on all saving throws and Constitution checks to stabilize as long as the threat persists. If the victim survives the event that triggered the warning, the effect ends and the victim does not gain the bonus the next time this type of event occurs. A warning is a morale effect.</p></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Mummys_Mask.jpg","_id":"f0Ab4ACVgj520lgs"}

Any creature that comes within 20 feet of a neshmaal must succeed at a DC 23 Will save or become shaken for 2d4 rounds. If a creature is within the auras of multiple neshmaals, only a single save is required, but the save DC increases by 2 for each additional neshmaal (for example, the presence of two neshmaals increases the usual save DC to 25). Arcane spellcasters are especially vulnerable to this aura. The DC to cast spells defensively within the aura increases by 4, and the neshmaal can make an attack of opportunity against an arcane caster who fails to cast defensively. This secondary effect occurs even if the arcane caster succeeded at her save against the shaken condition. Once a creature is exposed to a neshmaal's aura, it is immune to this effect for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting fear effect, and the save DC is Constitution-based.  </p><p><strong>Dominate Person (Sp)</strong> A neshmaal can dominate only one target at a time when using its <i>dominate person</i> spell-like ability. If a neshmaal uses its <i>dominate person</i> spell-like ability on a new target while already dominating another creature, the previous target is immediately released from the neshmaal's control. This occurs whether or not the new attempt is successful.  </p><p><strong>Kiss of the Void (Su)</strong> Three times per day, a neshmaal may forgo using energy drain on one of its three tendril attacks in a round and instead imbue the touch with the icy coldness of deep space. This attack deals an additional 6d6 points of cold damage and paralyzes the target for 1d4-1 rounds. A successful DC 23 Fortitude save halves the damage and negates the paralysis. The save DC is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Vulnerability to Sonic (Su)</strong> Neshmaals are native to the noiseless void of deep space or their own alien dimension and, as a result, are especially vulnerable to sonic damage. Magical attacks that cause sonic damage bypass the neshmaal's spell resistance, and they take half again as much damage (+50%) on a failed save (normal full damage on a successful save). If a neshmaal fails a saving throw against an effect that deals sonic damage, it has a 25% chance of being stunned for 1 round.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>The vast, dark spaces between the stars hold horrors aplenty, skulking in the unholy blackness with their aberrant desires and unspeakable appetites. Some of these beings exist simultaneously in two worlds, half in the emptiness of space and half in some other dimension of which mortals dare not even dream. The neshmaals are such a race, aliens of such inscrutable malice and hunger that even most other denizens of the darkness avoid them. These strange beings view the humanoids populating the universe as either cattle to eat or playthings to manipulate like marionettes.  A neshmaal's body is formed of a tangle of writhing tentacles that is roughly 9 feet across. As they are incorporeal outside of their home dimension, the creatures have no weight.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Neshmaals are incorporeal in the Material Plane. They may be corporeal in their own dimension, but no one has journeyed there and returned to verify this. In the Material Plane, neshmaals spend most of their time in the empty darkness of deep space, where extremes of temperature are commonplace and the varieties of weather found on terrestrial worlds have  no impact on these strange creatures. Due to this exceptional form of adaptation, neshmaals can be found virtually anywhere. Neshmaals have no need to breathe, so they are unaffected by inhaled poisons and can dwell underwater without restriction. Despite their many immunities and resistances, they are especially vulnerable to damage from sonic attacks, perhaps because they are accustomed to the silence of the void. Since outsiders don't normally need to eat, the neshmaals' ravenous hunger for the energy of all living creatures suggests that they manifest in the Material Plane only to gain sustenance. Neshmaals satisfy this hunger by draining the life force from living creatures, though it's assumed they also derive some nourishment from psychic energies from sentient beings as well, fear in particular.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Neshmaals, which exist at once on the Material Plane and in a dimension of their own, seem to have no interest in congress with other species, though they speak passable Aklo and possess telepathy. What little information exists about their culture is contradictory, though their endless appetites for raw life force support the theory that they are scavengers created by the Great Old Ones to cleanse worlds of sentience.  Neshmaals are occasionally found in the service of much more powerful otherworldly beings from the <i>Dark</i> Tapestry. Some scholars believe these creatures to be agents of the mysterious Dominion of the Black. This is a reasonable assumption, as they have similar inscrutable methodologies to the creatures that make up the Dominion, and neshmaals have been recorded in texts that deal with various creatures that make up the Dominion of the Black. The role neshmaals might play in that dark hierarchy is unclear.  Humanoid conjurers on the Material Plane have summoned these inscrutable beings to gain knowledge of the inky depths of the universe and beyond, though doing so places the conjurer's sanity in terrible jeopardy. The process is maddening, and the conjurer's safety is not diminished once the neshmaal is called to service. Attempting to obtain the service of a neshmaal is very dangerous, unless such service aligns with the neshmaal's goals, and only the mad can discern the nature of those goals. Neshmaals constantly modify the original agreement, and they often manipulate those they serve. A neshmaal's most common request is a never-ending chain of humanoids for them to drain of their life force.   It's unusual to find more than a few of these otherworldly creatures in one place, making it difficult to calculate their total numbers. Neshmaals employ telepathy to communicate with others of their kind; while doing so, they intertwine their tentacles and tendrils in a manic, lascivious embrace. The book <i>Secrets of the</i> <i>Dreaming</i> <i>Dark</i> (which is thankfully rare) provides the ritual to summon neshmaals. The tome also reports that neshmaals are somehow connected to, seeking, or fleeing from something cryptically referred to as the \"Black Alluvion Dream.\" Even occult scholars, astronomers, and other seekers of secrets tend to steer clear of this esoteric and dangerous topic, given that those few who have pursued its study now occupy carefully guarded cells in asylums across the Inner Sea Region.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Mummys_Mask.jpg","_id":"gaXsRS7lvM5FDDU1"}

Any creature attempting to contact an elder sphinx's mind or read its thoughts with a divination spell or similar ability must succeed at a DC 27 Will save or be overwhelmed by the chaos and vast scope of the knowledge within. Those who fail are affected by <i>feeblemind</i>. An elder sphinx can willingly suppress this ability at will as a free action. This is a mind-affecting effect, and the save DC is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Enigma (Su)</strong> Elder sphinxes have removed themselves from the mundane world to contemplate the mysteries of the universe-and beyond. To facilitate this, they possess an uncanny ability to elude detection and discovery by those that could possibly interrupt their meditations. Any creature (other than another sphinx), that leaves line of sight of an elder sphinx for more than 1 hour must succeed at a DC 27 Will save or be unable to recall details of the encounter, as if the sphinx cast <i>modify memory</i> to eliminate all recollection of itself. The exact details of this memory loss are decided by the elder sphinx subconsciously during the encounter and it may eliminate up to an hour of memories. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect and the save DC is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Litany of Riddles (Su)</strong> As a standard action, an elder sphinx can telepathically project a befuddling series of riddles, puzzles, and logic paradoxes at all creatures in a 60-foot cone. Creatures caught in this effect must succeed at a DC 27 Will save or be stunned for 1d4 rounds. Creatures that succeed against this effect glean snippets of lore from this brush with the sphinx's mind, granting them a +5 insight bonus on all Knowledge checks for 1 hour and the ability to attempt Knowledge checks with a DC higher than 10 untrained. Once a creature successfully saves against this ability, it can't be affected by the same elder sphinx's litany of riddles for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting effect and the save DC is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Sphinx Monolith (Su)</strong> An elder sphinx can enter a state of suspended animation and transform its massive body into a stone monument. This transformation takes 1 minute to complete, during which the elder sphinx is immobile. Once it transforms into its monolith form, the elder sphinx's body hardens to stone, granting it hardness 30 and 350 hit points. If the elder sphinx's stony body is reduced to 0 hit points, it is destroyed and the elder sphinx is slain. While transformed, an elder sphinx doesn't need to breathe, eat, drink, or sleep. The elder sphinx is aware of its surroundings and it can use <i>astral projection</i> at will when in this form. Anytime an elder sphinx's body takes damage while using <i>astral projection</i>, its astral form immediately becomes aware that it is in danger and can, as a free action, end the <i>astral projection</i> and begin reverting back to its natural form (though the process still takes 1 minute). When an elder sphinx ends its transformation, it is immediately healed of all hit point damage it may have sustained while transformed. An elder sphinx can remain in its sphinx monolith form indefinitely.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Older than most modern civilizations, elder sphinxes are the wisest and most venerable of sphinx kind. Though they have long since calcified into creatures of living limestone, these ancient creatures serve eternally as guardians, not of temples or other such terrestrial sites, but of forbidden knowledge and lore, much of which is beyond the understanding of lesser beings. Elder sphinxes are highly protective of the vast wealth of information they possess and strive to defend it from those they deem unworthy.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Sphinxes gradually become more sedentary over their long lifespans as they lose their inclination toward physical activity. The eldest and most knowledgeable sphinxes undergo a transformation that allows them to remain undisturbed as they ponder the knowledge they've obtained. They turn into creatures of living limestone and grow to tremendous proportions, until they resemble ancient and weathered statues. No longer content with the Material Plane, elder sphinxes cast their consciousnesses out into the Astral Plane and beyond in search of the secrets of the universe, as their mortal hunger for nourishment is replaced by a metaphysical hunger for knowledge.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Scholars claim that some elder sphinxes predate even the Age of Darkness and thus possess firsthand knowledge of the world as it once was, and have learned of the contemporary world only through their astral wandering or during the rare times they walk in their corporeal form. Whatever purpose they served in their youth has long since been forgotten or abandoned, leaving them to pursue more esoteric ambitions. These ancient creatures exist solely to seek out new information and to understand the great mysteries of the universe while their stony physical remains sit idle as time passes them by. In time, these elder sphinxes come to be seen as monuments, and sometimes humanoid cultures gather around them and worship them  as idols. Infrequently, elder sphinxes can be coaxed to trade ancient knowledge for more current information or for arcane secrets they have yet to divine from the planes. Finding knowledge or information beyond an elder sphinx's experiences, however, is as monumental a task as locating one of their kind.  Elder sphinxes have little to no contact with other sphinxes. This only occurs when a younger, less powerful sphinx seeks out one of these magnificent specimens to plead for lost knowledge. When elder sphinxes do come into contact with one another, it is always a meeting of great purpose, typically on a matter of such importance that it requires them to share their ancient wisdom and unfathomable lore.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Mummys_Mask.jpg","_id":"ngfY9tXntT1KRDCU"}

While accompanying travelers on their river journeys, river clerics make sure to educate the uninitiated on Wadjet and their ancient goddess's divine doctrine.</p><p>While attending to an Osirian river in accordance with Wadjet's tenets, river clerics expect to be p<i>aid</i> for their services just as any other guide or ferryman. Unlike others who perform similar functions, however, clerics of Wadjet use nearly all of their income to fund their deity's church. A river cleric never turns down a job unless she feels it clearly violates her deity's code of conduct (such as obstructing or defiling the river or acting against the interests of the pharaoh and his loyal subjects). Even when not ferrying clients, a river cleric can be found traveling along the river, offering her goddess's insight and blessings to the loyal subjects of the reigning pharaoh.</p><p>For more information on Wadjet and the other gods of Ancient Osirion, see <i>Pathfinder Adventure Path #80</i>: <i>Empty Graves</i>.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Mummys_Mask.jpg","_id":"oOx8tRwgGLHvStWW"}

When a Set guardian would be damaged by the specified energy type, it is instead unharmed. As a free action on the following round, it discharges this energy in a 20-foot radius dealing half again as much damage (150%) as it would have taken from the effect. This discharge occurs even if the Set guardian was destroyed on the previous round. A successful DC 21 Reflex save halves this damage. The gemstones in the eye sockets of the Set guardian's headpiece determine the energy type.  <i>Emerald</i>: Set guardians with emerald gemstones are immune to and absorb electricity damage.  Ruby: Set guardians with ruby gemstones are immune to and absorb fire damage.  <i>Sapphire</i>: Set guardians with sapphire gemstones are immune to and absorb cold damage.  <i>Topaz</i>: Set guardians with topaz gemstones are immune to and absorb acid damage.  Another Set guardian that has the same energy type keyed to this ability is unharmed by the damage from this burst, but also doesn't absorb the energy. The save DC is Constitution-based.  </p><p><strong>Mighty Blows (Ex)</strong> A Set guardian's slam attacks score a critical threat on a natural 18-20, and deal double damage on a critical hit. If both slam attacks successfully hit in a single round, the target is staggered for 1d4+1 rounds unless the target makes a successful DC 21 Fortitude save. The save DC is Constitution-based.  </p><p><strong>Trumpet of Doom (Su)</strong> Once every 3 rounds as a free action, a Set guardian can emit a sonic blast from its headpiece that deals 2d8+2 points of damage and stuns all creatures within 20 feet of the construct for a single round. A successful DC 21 Fortitude save halves the damage and negates the stunned condition. Other Set guardians are immune to this effect. This is a sonic effect, and the save DC is Constitution-based.  </p><p><strong>Unholy Weaknesses (Ex)</strong> Due to the necromantic techniques used in its creation, certain spells and effects affect a Set guardian differently than they otherwise would. A Set guardian is treated as undead for the purposes of spells or effects that deal more damage to undead, like <i>searing light</i>, <i>sunbeam</i>, or <i>sunburst</i>. A Set guardian in the area of effect of positive energy channeled to damage undead is slowed 1 round for every 3d6 points of damage channeled (minimum 1 round). A <i>raise dead</i> spell cast on a Set guardian paralyzes it for 1d4 rounds.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>In the days of Ancient Osirion, when temples to the old gods still stood throughout the nation, worshipers of Set protected their places of worship with imposing constructs. To allow the priests of these old gods to devote their time and energy to ecclesiastical duties, Set's clerics designed these foul sentinels to be self-sufficient by using a combination of necromantic techniques and golem crafting.  The clerics and crafters preparing the constructs would begin with the body of an evil desert giant-preferably one who, like them, revered Set. The crafters would then fashion headpieces out of brass, bronze, or iron that were sculpted in the likeness of the god of darkness, deserts, murder, and storms. The headpiece would then be lacquered a glossy black, and set with expensive gemstones indicative of the type of elemental spirit used to animate the construct. After the headpiece was crafted, the preserved desert giant would be decapitated and the headpiece affixed to its shoulders.  The towering constructs stood within the sanctuaries of Set's great temples across the empire, and were often posted at the temple's exterior doors when the faithful were called to worship. The laity always assumed that the constructs were undead servants crowned with metal helms of their god, and the clergy did nothing to disabuse them of this conceit. Indeed, adventurers often make the same mistake. Opponents can use Knowledge (religion) to identify a Set guardian's true nature and learn about the construct's unholy weaknesses.  During the dark decades of Hakotep's reign, the guardians were a common-and for many, terrifying-sight, for the pharaoh used them as tools to threaten and cow the priesthoods of cults opposed to his religious reforms favoring Set. Today, these constructs have fallen out of favor in ecclesiastical circles-few of the modern cults employ them, though a couple of the surviving temples formerly dedicated to Set still boast one of these giant wardens. Most encounters with Set guardians today are reported by archaeological parties exploring lost temples or the tombs of long-buried nobles who had some devotion to the god in life. Once frightening attendants in temples across the land, they now wait in darkness for those unwisely disturbing ancient burial sites.  Set guardians stand a towering 18 feet tall and weigh approximately 12,000 pounds.   <br /><strong>Construction</strong><br />  The process begins with the recently deceased body of an evil desert giant. The body must undergo a painstaking embalming process. This preparation keeps the body from rotting and hardens its flesh, making it as tough as stone. During this time, a headpiece made from 1,500 pounds of bronze, brass, or iron must be cast using special, cursed elixirs in the process. The head of the preserved giant must be severed cleanly at the shoulders and the headpiece then bolted on. At this point, two gems (each worth at least 2,000 gp) of the appropriate type are fitted into the headpiece's eye sockets before the construct is animated with an elemental spirit. <br /></p><p><button id=\"importStatblock\">Import Set Guardian with SBC</button></p><section id=\"SetGuardian\"><div class=\"heading\"><p class=\"alignleft\">Set Guardian</p>  <strong>CL</strong> 17th; <strong>Price</strong> 184,000 gp  <br /><hr /><strong>Construction</strong><hr />  <strong>Requirements</strong> Craft Construct, <i>blasphemy</i>, <i>geas/quest</i>, <i>miracle</i>; <strong>Skill</strong> Heal DC 20 and Craft (armor) or Craft (blacksmithing) DC 22; <strong>Cost</strong> 90,000 gp.   <br /><strong>ELEVATED SET GUARDIANS</strong><br />  Clerics of Set wishing to create more powerful constructs to guard their temples experimented with many different methods and finally came upon a process that resulted in the creation of an elevated Set guardian. These constructs went through a preservation process that utilized more expensive materials than those of the standard guardian, and were animated with two separate elemental spirits. Such constructs can be identified by two different gems (matching the two spirits that animate them) fitted into their headpieces. An elevated Set guardian can also be animated with two elemental spirits of the same type, though the construct is easily mistaken for a standard Set guardian because its gemstone eyes are the same color.  Elevated Set guardians are at least CR 15, have the advanced creature simple template, and their elemental conduit ability is keyed to two different energy types. Elevated Set guardians imbued with two elemental spirits of the same type discharge double the amount of energy damage they would have taken instead of half again as much.  <br /><strong>Construction</strong>  The process of creating an elevated Set guardian is nearly identical to creating a regular Set guardian except for the cost of the required materials. The gemstones fitted into the construct's eye sockets each must be worth at least 5,000 gp.  <br /><div class=\"heading\"><p class=\"alignleft\">Elevated Set Guardian</p>  <strong>CL</strong> 18th; <strong>Price</strong> 210,000 gp  <br /><strong>Construction</strong>  <strong>Requirements</strong> Craft Construct, <i>blasphemy</i>, <i>geas/quest</i>, <i>miracle</i>; <strong>Skill</strong> Heal DC 26 and Craft (armor) or Craft (blacksmithing) DC 28; <strong>Cost</strong> 110,000 gp.</div></div></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Mummys_Mask.jpg","_id":"qLNKrZUZZv6iaBm5"}

It is here where the strong elemental forces and the massive loss of mortal life used to excavate the earthworks combined to create these terrifying creatures.  Hakotep I drove thousands of slaves to dig the elaborate system of earthworks and deep trenches, and though no one's certain of the site's purpose, some speculate that it is an arcane device constructed to defend against any perceived Shory invasion using their flying cities.  Obelisks bound with elemental spirits were erected throughout the system, and as time crept along, some of these spirits escaped their prisons and fused with the remains of the slaves who once toiled in the trenches. Now, ossumentals act as unintended guardians and caretakers of the site. Those exploring this region have reported that some of the ossumentals maintain the Slave Trenches of Hakotep by keeping the deep trenches clear of the ever-encroaching desert sands, though they are only successful for a matter of time before the winds drive the sand again.  The creatures aren't always active; at rest, their bones lie scattered under the oppressive Osirian sun, waiting for living creatures to wander by before clattering together to attack. An ossumental is a tricky combatant, attacking with its four arms in melee combat and then using its breath weapon to attack multiple targets that are out of reach. It makes use of its discorporate ability to quickly shift position on the battlefield and get behind its attackers.  Fully formed, an ossumental stands approximately 16 feet tall and weighs around 300 pounds.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Mummys_Mask.jpg","_id":"qNmIo91wRqrpMNm6"}

Such desiccated corpses near pyramids or other areas with strong necromantic magic sometimes rise as sunbaked zombies. With their corporeal bodies warped by the sun, and their innards but a dry facsimile of living organs, sunbaked zombies use the gifts of the sun to lash those who cross their paths. A sunbaked zombie is the same size as its original form, but typically weighs less than half its original weight.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Other than the dry, leathery skin clinging to the creature's bones, the most striking physical difference between a sunbaked zombie and a normal zombie is the sunbaked zombie's flame-filled eye sockets. Though it lacks functioning eyes-those having long since shriveled to dust-the sunbaked zombie can see as well as any other zombie, and the flames in its dried sockets can set enemies afire. With its dried, taut skin and taut and insides reduced to dust, it retains a normal zombie's resistance to damage. When its animating spark is extinguished, a sunbaked zombie's corpse bursts into a cloud of poisonous gas, choking those around it.  So long as the sun shines, sunbaked zombies move about as if with purpose. At night, however, they wander in circles until the sun blazes across the morning sky  once more. The faint light given off by their eye sockets, combined with their stumbling movement, has led some desert nomads to claim they are desert will-o-wisps.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Sun-baked zombies most often rise near pyramids and other burial sites in hot deserts, where latent necromantic energy lingers from countless arcane rituals and restless spirits. As such, sunbaked zombies are primarily found among the dunes of Osirion and the other nations that make up northern Garund. Typically animated in isolation, sunbaked zombies rarely form hordes like normal zombies, but when entire caravans fall to thirst and the desert sun, all of its members might rise as these terrible undead.  When one intentionally raises a sunbaked zombie using <i>animate dead</i>, the body to be raised must be left out in the sun's rays for a full 12 hours and must be salted every hour during this time to hasten its desiccation. Spell effects that produce light work for this purpose only if they count as actual sunlight, and even then they must be combined with <i>desecrate</i>. Casting the animating spell at night always fails; the sun must be out and directly beating down on the corpse. Without the intense magical focus of a spell, it takes many days for the corpse to absorb enough sun and necromantic energy to rise spontaneously.  <br /><strong>Creating a Sunbaked Zombie</strong><br /> \"Sunbaked zombie\" is an acquired template that can be added to any corporeal creature (other than undead), referred to hereafter as the base creature.  <br /><strong>CR:</strong> This depends on the creature's new total number of Hit Dice, as follows.   </p><table><tbody><tr><th>HD</th><th>CR</th><th>XP</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1/2</td><td>200</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>400</td></tr><tr><td>3-4</td><td>2</td><td>600</td></tr><tr><td>5-6</td><td>3</td><td>800</td></tr><tr><td>7-8</td><td>4</td><td>1,200</td></tr><tr><td>9-10</td><td>5</td><td>1,600</td></tr><tr><td>11-12</td><td>6</td><td>2,400</td></tr><tr><td>13-16</td><td>7</td><td>3,200</td></tr><tr><td>17-20</td><td>8</td><td>4,800</td></tr><tr><td>21-24</td><td>9</td><td>6,400</td></tr></tbody></table>    <br /><strong>Alignment:</strong> Always neutral evil.  <br /><strong>Type:</strong> The creature's type changes to undead. It retains any subtypes except for alignment subtypes (such as good) and subtypes that indicate kind (such as giant). It does not gain the augmented subtype.  <br /><strong>Armor Class:</strong> The natural armor bonus is based on the creature's size.   <table><tbody><tr><th>Sunbaked Zombie Size</th><th>Natural Armor Bonus</th></tr><tr><td>Tiny or smaller</td><td>+0</td></tr><tr><td>Small</td><td>+1</td></tr><tr><td>Medium</td><td>+2</td></tr><tr><td>Large</td><td>+3</td></tr><tr><td>Huge</td><td>+4</td></tr><tr><td>Gargantuan</td><td>+7</td></tr><tr><td>Colossal</td><td>+11</td></tr></tbody></table>     <br /><strong>Hit Dice:</strong> Drop Hit Dice gained from class levels (to a minimum of 1) and change racial HD to d8s. Sunbaked zombies gain additional HD as noted on the following table. Sunbaked zombies use their Charisma modifiers to determine bonus hit points (instead of Constitution).    <table><tbody><tr><th>Sunbaked Zombie Size Bonus</th><th>Hit Dice</th></tr><tr><td>Tiny or smaller</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Small or Medium</td><td>+1 HD</td></tr><tr><td>Large</td><td>+2 HD</td></tr><tr><td>Huge</td><td>+4 HD</td></tr><tr><td>Gargantuan</td><td>+6 HD</td></tr><tr><td>Colossal</td><td>+10 HD</td></tr></tbody></table>     <br /><strong>Saves:</strong> A sunbaked zombie's base save bonuses are Fort +1/3 HD, Ref +1/3 HD, and Will +1/2 HD + 2.  <br /><strong>Defensive Abilities:</strong> A sunbaked zombie loses the base creature's defensive abilities and gains DR 5/slashing and resist fire 10 (or immunity to fire if it has 11 HD or more), as well as all of the standard immunities and traits granted by the undead type.  <br /><strong>Speed:</strong> Winged sunbaked zombies can still fly, but their maneuverability drops to clumsy. If the base creature flew magically, so can the sunbaked zombie. Retain all other movement types.  <br /><strong>Attacks:</strong> A sunbaked zombie retains all natural weapons, manufactured weapon attacks, and weapon proficiencies of the base creature. It also gains a slam attack that deals damage based on the sunbaked zombie's size, but as if it were one size category larger than its actual size (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</i> 301-302).  <br /><strong>Special Attacks:</strong> A sunbaked zombie retains none of the base creature's special attacks, but gains the following.  <br /><i>Death Throes (Su)</i>: When a sunbaked zombie is destroyed, its body explodes in a burst of stale dust. Adjacent creatures must succeed at a Fortitude save or be staggered for 1d4+1 rounds. The DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 the sunbaked zombie's Hit Dice + the sunbaked zombie's Cha modifier. Creatures that don't breathe are immune to this effect.  <br /><i>Fiery Gaze (Su)</i>: A sunbaked zombie's eye sockets flicker with a small flame that gives light equivalent to that of a candle. As a standard action, a sunbaked zombie can direct its gaze against a single creature within 30 feet of it. A creature targeted must succeed at a Fortitude save  or take 1d6 points of fire damage. If the sunbaked zombie has 5 or more Hit Dice, its fiery gaze deals 2d6 points of fire damage, and this damage increases by an additional 1d6 points of fire damage for every 4 additional Hit Dice the sunbaked zombie possesses. A creature damaged by this effect must succeed at a Reflex save or catch fire. Each round, a burning creature can attempt a Reflex save to quench the flames; failure results in another 1d6 points of fire damage. Flammable items worn by a creature must also save or take the same damage as the creature. If a creature is already on fire, it suffers no additional effects from a fiery gaze. The save DC is Charisma-based.  <br /><strong>Abilities:</strong> Str +2. A sunbaked zombie has no Con or Int score, and its Wis and Cha become 10.  <br /><strong>BAB:</strong> A sunbaked zombie's base attack bonus is equal to 3/4 of its Hit Dice.  <br /><strong>Skills:</strong> A sunbaked zombie has no skill ranks.  <br /><strong>Feats:</strong> A sunbaked zombie loses all feats possessed by the base creature and gains Toughness as a bonus feat.  <br /><strong>Special Qualities:</strong> A sunbaked zombie loses most special qualities of the base creature. It retains any extraordinary special qualities that improve its melee or ranged attacks.</h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Mummys_Mask.jpg","_id":"rEzn8DWFdYkJY5Pg"}

She's patient and would prefer to deny her enemies opportunities for full attacks anyway, believing that extending her time in battle will give her greater opportunities to spread out the pain and suffering she hopes to inflict to alleviate her boredom. If reduced to fewer than 120 hit points, though, her base nature begins to take over and she grows more feral and violent, activating her dust vortex in the center of the room to fill the entire area before focusing her attacks on the most wounded foes, now attempting to set up full attacks against her enemies in order to finish them off.</p><p><strong>Morale </strong>Agazuberi fights to the death.</p></div><hr /><div><p><strong>STATISTICS</strong></p></div><hr /><div><p><strong>Str </strong>26, <strong>Dex </strong>22, <strong>Con </strong>23, <strong>Int </strong> 12, <strong>Wis </strong>15, <strong>Cha </strong>18</p><p><strong>Base Atk </strong>+20; <strong>CMB </strong>+29; <strong>CMD </strong>46</p><p><strong>Feats </strong>Bleeding Critical, Combat Reflexes, Critical Focus, Dodge, Improved Critical (falchion), Improved Initiative, Iron Will, Mobility, Spring Attack, Weapon Focus (falchion)</p><p><strong>Skills </strong>Acrobatics +29, Bluff +27, Fly +4, Intimidate +27, Knowledge (religion) +24, Perception +25, Sense Motive +25, Stealth +25 (+33 in storms or clouds)</p><p><strong>Languages </strong>Ancient Osiriani, Aquan, Auran, Ignan, Terran</p><p><strong>SQ </strong>aligned weapons, stormwalk</p><p><strong>Gear </strong><i>+1 <i>conductive falchion</i></i>, <i>ring of <i>freedom of movement</i></i>, gem encrusted gold pectoral necklace worth 10,000 gp</p></div><hr /><div><p><strong>SPECIAL ABILITIES</strong></p></div><hr /><div><p><strong>Aligned Weapons (Su)</strong> A black jinni's natural weapons and any weapon she wields are treated as chaotic and evil for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction.  </p><p><strong>Create Spawn (Su)</strong> A humanoid or genie slain by a black jinni's melee attacks enhanced by her shocking touch rises 1d4 rounds later as an undead spawn. Humans rise as zombies, jann rise as ghuls (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 3</i> 125), and djinn, efreet, shaitans, and marids rise as great ghuls   (see page 51). Any spawn created by a black jinni are under her control.  </p><p><strong>Dust Vortex (Su)</strong> Once per day, as a full-round action, a black jinni can cause the obscuring cloud that surrounds her to become a vortex of electrically charged dust. This vortex is 20 feet high and radiates to a range of 30 feet, with the black jinni at the vortex's center. The winds within this area are considered a windstorm (<i>Core Rulebook</i> 439). Creatures within the vortex that would normally be blown away are instead drawn toward the center to a square adjacent to the black jinni. A creature that ends its turn within the dust vortex takes 10d6 points of electricity damage (Reflex DC 23 half). Once the dust vortex is created, it remains stationary, allowing the black jinni to move around in it or even leave it. The vortex remains in place for 1d6 rounds, or until the black jinni dismisses it as a move action. The save DC is Constitution-based.  </p><p><strong>Obscuring Cloud (Ex)</strong> A black jinni is continually surrounded by a cloud of obscuring dust and scouring wind. This cloud gives her a +8 racial bonus on Stealth checks while within a sandstorm or other area of blowing dust. In addition, a black jinni has concealment (20% miss chance) while the cloud is in effect. Any strong (or stronger) wind can suppress the obscuring cloud as long as the wind persists.  </p><p><strong>Shocking Touch (Su)</strong> Any creature hit by a black jinni's claw attack or its <i>conductive falchion</i> takes an additional 1d10 points of electricity damage-on a critical hit, this additional electricity damage increases to 2d10 points of damage and the creature must succeed at a DC 23 Fortitude save or the electricity lingers on its body, dealing an additional 1d10 points of electricity damage each round on the start of the victim's turn for 1d6 additional rounds. Immersion in any liquid ends this ongoing damage, as does contact with a metal object of at least Medium or larger size that is in contact with the ground. The save DC is Constitution-based.  </p><p><strong>Stormwalk (Ex)</strong> A black jinni is able to move about in any storm of natural or unnatural origin of hurricane velocity or less without suffering any of its effects.  </p><p><strong>Vulnerability to Recitation (Ex)</strong> As cursed genies of evil and chaos, black jinn are strangely susceptible to recitations of certain holy tracts belonging to good or lawful deities or philosophies. These include the spells <i>dictum</i> and <i>holy word</i>, but also forceful recitations of nonmagical holy sermonizing. If a cleric or paladin of a lawful or good deity succeeds at an opposed Knowledge (religion) check against a black jinni's Knowledge (religion) check as a standard action, the black jinni must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save or be instantly destroyed, leaving behind only a small spot of charred ash. If this save is successful, the black jinni instead takes 5d6 points of damage. Unlike most black jinn, though, Agazuberi is particularly patient and accepting of such recitations-she gains a +4 bonus on her Fortitude   saves and Knowledge (religion) checks when reacting to this weakness.</p></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Mummys_Mask.jpg","_id":"sEgSIaJK5CSkvNZh"}

To use this version of its nauseating spray, the walking stick must succeed at a ranged touch attack (+5 for most walking sticks). If the target is hit, it must succeed at a DC 17 Fortitude save or become nauseated for 5 rounds; otherwise, it is sickened for 5 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>More common in rocky badlands than the great sandy dunes, stick bugs of all sizes are often mistaken for the fallen palm fronds or thorny leaf less trees found near oases and other spots in the desert where vegetation grows. Giant walking sticks often remain motionless for days at a time, waiting for the right prey to pass by before striking. When engaged with a foe too difficult to overtake, giant walking sticks flee from the fight. They usually expel their nauseating spray in these situations, but some can even break off their own limbs in order to escape, regrowing the missing arm or leg later once they're safe.  A fully grown giant walking stick stretches from 6 to 10 feet long, but typically weighs only 120 pounds.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Mummys_Mask.jpg","_id":"tAGuDqs5n8j7QGfH"}

Though rare, serpopards are naturally occurring beasts native to the deserts of northern Garund. Superstitious folk who believe that the gods' hands touch everything beneath the blistering Osirian sun see the serpopard as a cursed creature, marked with snakelike features by Apep and forced to wander eternally through the desert, never to find rest or sanctuary. On the other hand, carvings on ceremonial plates, on uncovered artifacts, and in ruined temples make it clear that the god-kings of Ancient Osirion once kept serpopards as pets or servants, as depictions of these creatures in the oldest of Osirion's ruins often show them chained or collared, bowing obediently to human masters.  Serpopards stand approximately 3 feet tall at the shoulder; when their necks are fully extended, they can measure up to 20 feet long from nose to tail. Serpopards weigh anywhere from 150 to 200 lbs.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Though serpopards are most common in the deserts of northern Garund, travelers in such far-off locales as the Meraz Desert in Qadira, the Cinderlands of Varisia, and the vast expanse of Shaguang in Tian Xia to the east have spotted creatures matching the serpopards' description. Some sages hypothesize that the most powerful or ancient serpopards can cross greater distances with their dune step ability, and thus travel through it to distant deserts across Golarion. Such experts say it's therefore likely that all deserts hold populations of serpopards, though they may be few in number or very isolated.  Serpopards are largely nocturnal, preferring to hunt at night when they can use the cover of darkness to approach prey undetected. When hunting, they rely on their speed and powerful claws to take down large quarry, and then use the additional reach provided by their unusually long necks to defend their kills from scavengers and competing hunters. Serpopards are not averse to eating intelligent beings, and hunt humanoids if the opportunity or need arises, but they aren't cruel- serpopards gain no pleasure from such acts beyond the satisfaction of a fresh meal.  On average, serpopards have a lifespan of about 50 years, but rumors exist of serpopards living much longer than this. One town along the northern coast of Rahadoum claims a single serpopard has visited its outskirts once every decade for the past 100 years.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Serpopards are mainly solitary creatures. Very rarely do they travel in pairs, and then only during mating season or in the case of littermates who chose not to separate at adulthood. When living as mated pairs, the father stays only until the cubs are able to run, but the mother stays with the cubs much longer, teaching them how to hunt and use their special ability to travel between the dunes. Mothers also pass on to the cubs their understanding of the land, instructing them as to which areas are good for hunting or exploring, what kinds of places to avoid, and how to find fresh water. Young serpopards separate from their mother individually, leaving as soon as they mature and feel confident navigating their way through the desert alone.  When traveling, serpopards range anywhere from 50 to 100 miles per day, stopping only to hunt, rest, or (more rarely) explore some aged ruin. No one knows what fascination these ancient works hold for the serpopards, but the creatures' interest in such locations is undeniable. An old poem involving serpopards claims that the creatures visit these ancient ruins because they are pining for the lost empire of Ancient Osirion.  Serpopards are clever liars and frustrating conversationalists, and hold a reputation among other races as skilled deceivers. In rural parts of Osirion, those with a gift for deception are often said to have \"the tongue of a <i>sedja</i>,\" while young children caught in a lie are warned that their \"necks are growing\" with each lie they tell. Despite this potential untrustworthiness, many people still seek the aid of serpopards. Few creatures know the deserts of Osirion as well as serpopards, and for the right price many are willing to guide groups of people across the desert. It's usually best to ensure the serpopard is well fed before undertaking such a journey, however, for a hungry serpopard may turn on its traveling companions if it thinks it can make a quick meal out of them. Serpopards have little use for gold and rarely accept it as payment for their services, though some apparently take a liking to jewelry, as travelers report the creatures as frequently wearing necklaces and bracelets when encountered. Food and hospitality are always acceptable payments, for those two things are in short supply in the harsh expanse of the desert. For those wishing to earn a serpopard's true faith and loyalty, however, one form of compensation stands above all others-divination magic. Serpopards are unceasingly curious about what their futures hold, and put great stock in the words of those who can tell fortunes or predict events to come.  Serpopards attack most sphinxes on sight, often fighting at least long enough to get in a few solid blows before retreating between the dunes to safety. The only exception to this is androsphinxes, which most serpopards fear for some unknown reason. Only the bravest or most desperate serpopards face down such creatures in combat without aid; most flee immediately once they spot these mighty sphinxes. Sphinxes are aware of this antipathy and treat serpopards accordingly. Perhaps as a consequence of their antipathy toward sphinxes, serpopards also hate riddles and word games, and prefer to twist their words with lies and omissions rather than making a game out of conversation. Ignorant travelers who confuse the two creatures and try to engage the serpopard in a bout of riddling can find themselves in a dangerous predicament.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Mummys_Mask.jpg","_id":"wDVia0o9mKqKEn7L"}

Few ammuts exist, and those that do wander the vast deserts of Osirion preying on the souls of any creature they can catch. These creatures prefer the taste of thoroughly evil souls or those who have experienced full and complex lives. Ammuts show disdain for creatures of inferior intelligence, but also tend to leave them alone, as they claim their souls are shallow and flavorless. The rarity of ammuts and their nomadic nature makes it difficult to determine how long they live, or even if they age at all. Ammuts are approximately 20 feet long and 9 feet tall at the shoulder. Their rounded and muscular hindquarters makes them denser than would be expected for their size, and ammuts can weigh up to 10 tons.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Ammuts live among the ruins scattered throughout the Osirian deserts, often lairing in abandoned and lost temples of the gods of Ancient Osirion. When outside their lairs, ammuts bury themselves in sand to await the arrival of a suitable meal.  An ammut is covered in fur ranging from sandy-colored to dark brown, with shorter fur on its back and legs, and a long mane behind its head that covers its shoulders. Its snout and face are layered in reptilian scales that are usually crusted with sand that has partially fused into glass from the heat of its breath.  Ammuts never tire, and once an ammut notices a creature that it considers suitable prey, it's unrelenting- stalking its prey for hundreds of miles if need be before running it down. These terrifying chases generally don't  last long, as the ammut makes use of a high-pitched scream that dazes prey long enough to allow the beast to catch and devour them. If that tactic fails to net the ammut its meal, it can also use its powerful force of will to dominate its prey, using telepathy to convince the victim to approach. Creatures that try to hide from an ammut using illusions soon find those plans foiled, as ammuts can see through illusions cast by even the most powerful mages. The only way to truly escape an ammut once it selects you as its quarry is to confront and defeat the beast.  Fire burns within the core of an ammut, and the heat generated by an ammut's inner fires can sometimes fuse the sand it passes through into glassy depressions in the desert floor. The best desert guides can recognize these signs (called \"blaze bowls\") and avoid areas in which an ammut might be lurking.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Ammuts are lone predators, and are so rare their social structures (if any) and method of reproduction are unknown. No live specimen has ever been caught for observation, because the inner fires of the ammut consume the creature's body quickly upon its death, leaving little to be studied besides ash and brittle glass formed from fused sand. Every so often, a peddler in the markets of Eto or Shiman-Sekh will claim to possess a rare piece of an ammut's body (such as one of its teeth or an eye) that they try to sell to foreigners and treasure hunters. Most native Osirians know to ignore such claims, but outsiders may be gullible enough to buy the extremely expensive fakes as souvenirs. One of the few things peddled in these markets that actually has a connection to ammuts are pieces of their blaze bowls. Sometimes brave explorers come across one of these glassy depressions, and remain in the area long enough to try to carefully remove the fused sand in one whole piece. More often than not these efforts are fruitless, as the brittle glass often crumbles if mishandled.  Because ammuts are so rare, the libraries of Osirion contain records of only two-dozen confirmed sightings, though it's likely that many more encounters ended with no one left to report the event. Osirian scholars have estimated, based more on reports of the telltale blaze bowls than of actual ammuts, that there are perhaps twenty to thirty  of the creatures roaming the vast wasteland between the Junira River and the River Sphinx, though a single sighting near the Ruins of Tumen suggests the ammuts are not confined between those waterways. No record of a peaceful encounter with an ammut exists, suggesting that they have no interest in anything other than feeding on the souls of those who cross their paths.  The origin of the ammuts is shrouded in mystery, though it's thought that they descended from a single creature of their kind that was more powerful than all existing ammuts combined. This mythical ammut is sometimes referred to in Ancient Osiriani scrolls where it has the position of judging the souls of the dead-a role already assumed by Pharasma. Because of this conf lict, scholars argue about the creatures' true origin.  Though it is generally agreed that ammuts migrated to Golarion from another plane long ago, many scholars disagree on the exact planar origin. Some scholars claim that ammuts are perhaps descended from a race of devils, while others claim the lineage stems from the divs. The most logical association of a fiendish origin is rooted in daemonkind. That ammuts are connected with souls and have the ability to utterly consume them certainly lends to this hypothesis.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Mummys_Mask.jpg","_id":"wZKraXIIg5AbDdk6"}

Any creature within 120 feet that attempts to move during its turn must succeed at a DC 14 Will save or be forced to move toward the estuarine worm instead of in its intended direction. This ability is otherwise treated a gaze attack. This ability is a mind-affecting illusion (pattern) effect, though vermin are not immune to this effect. The estuarine worm can activate and deactivate this ability as a free action. The save DC is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Seasonal Transformation (Ex)</strong> An estuarine worm has two forms: ahket (wet season) and shemu (dry season). In its shemu form, the estuarine worm is one size category smaller than when it's in its ahket form. Further, its Strength and Dexterity decrease by 8 and it loses its damage reduction. It also loses its guiding star ability and its willful special quality. Its natural armor bonus increases by 8 and it gains DR 15/ bludgeoning. In addition, all of the creature's movement speeds are decreased by 10 feet.  An estuarine worm assumes its shemu form if it goes 24 hours without exposure to water. An estuarine worm that is targeted by a <i>control water</i> (lower water), <i>greater polymorph</i>, <i>flesh to stone</i>, or <i>transmute mud to rock</i> spell immediately shifts to its shemu form (instead of experiencing the spell's normal effect).  An estuarine worm takes on ahket form if it is submerged in water for 24 hours. An estuarine worm that is targeted by a <i>control water</i> (raise water), <i>greater polymorph</i>, <i>stone to flesh</i>, or <i>transmute rock to mud</i> spell immediately shifts to its ahket form (instead of experiencing the spell's normal effect).  </p><p><strong>Willful (Ex)</strong> In ahket form, an estuarine worm gains a +4 competence bonus to Will saves against enchantment spells and effects.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>When Alboras, one of the brightest navigable stars, returns to the night sky, it is a sure sign the River Sphinx will soon flood its banks and replenish the land after the harvest. The inundation also revives the rare but deadly estuarine worms. During the wet season, which is called <i>akhet</i> in Osiriani, the giant worms hunt the flooded plains. When the waters recede and Alboras disappears below the horizon again, the estuarine worms retreat as well. During shemu, the dry season, they enter a semi-torpid state and lie buried beneath the dry soil for protection.  A typical estuarine worm measures 25 feet long and 3 feet wide during the wet season. The worms have a bioluminescent organ atop their heads. At night, the tiny,   flickering light might be mistaken for a star low on the horizon. When the dry season comes, the estuarine worm contracts to become half as long and half as wide. Its skin, once soft and spongy like wet mud, becomes as hard as stone.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Estuarine worms are most active when the River Sphinx is at its highest levels and crests its banks. Though the farmers leave when their lands flood, those who live on the edges of the flood plain, as well as those who sail the river, are still at risk of attack by these predators. Estuarine worms bury themselves in the mud during the day and emerge to hunt at night when it is cooler. The carnivorous worms eat whatever they can find, from fish and frogs, to livestock and people. They have even been known to gorge on crocodiles and hippopotamuses, after which they bury themselves for a time in order to digest their hefty meals. The lights on their heads attract small animals above and below the water, which in turn can attract larger prey. Stories are told of travelers who mistake the light for Alboras and navigate their small riverboats right into the maw of a worm.  As the floods recede, the estuarine worms become less active. When the land above them is no longer underwater, the worms remain buried in the moist soil. For the rest of the year, they live off fat and water stored during the wet season. The worms' flesh contracts, becoming denser in the process. It is commonly believed that the worms, like the soil, harden from dehydration, but it is, in fact, a natural defense mechanism. Though they might seem to be asleep, estuarine worms remain a danger in the dry season. When the worm's resting spot is too shallow or a plow digs too deep, farmers risk disturbing a worm in its hibernation. Though the worms may not be as agile or as hungry during this time, they are still dangerous predators.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Estuarine worms are typically solitary hunters. They reproduce parthenogenetically, and thus have little need for contact with others of their kind. Estuarine worms reproduce rarely, but birth large numbers of offspring when they do. Most of the spawn, however, are eaten by other predators long before they reach full size. When multiple worms are found together (usually because of lower-than-normal floodwater), only the alpha worm uses its bioluminescence. This sign of dominance also keeps potential prey from being drawn to multiple light sources.  Several cults in Osirion keep estuarine worms as sacred beasts in their secret temples. Worshipers of both Lamashtu and Rovagug believe it was their respective god who birthed these worms. Members of the Old Cults revere estuarine worms for their connection to the star Alboras and the Great Old One who supposedly dwells there. The cultists seek out the worms during the season of shemu, when the worms are less violent and more tractable. A combination of brute force and magic are necessary to find, exhume, and contain these elusive creatures. In captivity, estuarine worms can be made to change form regardless of the season through the application or exclusion of water. The high priests of these cults also know certain spells that can trigger an immediate change. The cultists connect to their god through the worms, offering sacrifices to them and reading omens in their violent squirming. The worms serve as guards against intruders, and can also be used as weapons against the cult's enemies.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Mummys_Mask.jpg","_id":"ybgNaN4oLgPQmjvU"}

It is here where the strong elemental forces and the massive loss of mortal life used to excavate the earthworks combined to create these terrifying creatures.  Hakotep I drove thousands of slaves to dig the elaborate system of earthworks and deep trenches, and though no one's certain of the site's purpose, some speculate that it is an arcane device constructed to defend against any perceived Shory invasion using their flying cities.  Obelisks bound with elemental spirits were erected throughout the system, and as time crept along, some of these spirits escaped their prisons and fused with the remains of the slaves who once toiled in the trenches. Now, ossumentals act as unintended guardians and caretakers of the site. Those exploring this region have reported that some of the ossumentals maintain the Slave Trenches of Hakotep by keeping the deep trenches clear of the ever-encroaching desert sands, though they are only successful for a matter of time before the winds drive the sand again.  The creatures aren't always active; at rest, their bones lie scattered under the oppressive Osirian sun, waiting for living creatures to wander by before clattering together to attack. An ossumental is a tricky combatant, attacking with its four arms in melee combat and then using its breath weapon to attack multiple targets that are out of reach. It makes use of its discorporate ability to quickly shift position on the battlefield and get behind its attackers.  Fully formed, an ossumental stands approximately 16 feet tall and weighs around 300 pounds.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Mummys_Mask.jpg","_id":"ykpPMF6Wz3Kkrc4H"}

Those who intrude upon the realm of a cynosphinx and fail to offer a tribute of secret knowledge provoke the beast to savage anger.  Whereas androsphinxes barter information for the sake of achieving enlightenment, cynosphinxes strive to learn secrets to gain power over others. Often, a cynosphinx enters a parley hoping to secretly learn clandestine information with its ability to read its target's thoughts, steering the conversation toward such topics with leading questions. Quick to anger, the cynosphinx kills those it feels are inferior, knowing that it still has the opportunity to converse with the trespasser after its death. If the knowledge it seeks is relayed during clever, amusing conversation, the sphinx rewards the provider with invaluable clues to a desired object or location, or simply safe passage through its territory, though the cynosphinx rarely shares any of its own secrets willingly. A cynosphinx stands 12 feet tall at its powerful shoulders. Built of muscular flesh and sinew, a cynosphinx weighs roughly 1,200 pounds.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Rare even among sphinxes, a cynosphinx is a terror of the desert. Were it not for its fixation on secrets, it would be a scourge to all who dwell among the sands. Its canine head grants it a sense of smell superior to that of other sphinxes, giving it the ability to stalk prey in conditions of poor visibility. Though it possesses massive wings, a cynosphinx is an ungainly flier. In addition to hit-and-run attacks from above, one of its favored tactics is to hover over an enemy and whip up a cloud of dust and debris to blind its prey.  Like all sphinxes, a cynosphinx is long-lived, but it has a particularly selfish desire to cling to its lengthy existence, making it a careful combatant who will flee rather than perish. This obsession usually leads a cynosphinx to search out the secrets of longevity and immortality, not just for its own use, but also because it knows the value mortals place on such secrets.  A cynosphinx requires little sustenance and even prefers to feed on carrion, finding rotting flesh more palatable. Because of this, an area with a few hundred gravesites can sustain a cynosphinx for several millennia. Even when a cynosphinx makes a fresh kill, the creature lets it rot for several days before devouring the carcass. Its diet mainly consists of the decaying corpses found abandoned within its lair, with bone marrow being a particular treat. Due to its affinity with the dead, and its obsessive need to learn secrets, a cynosphinx always interacts with its exhumed morsels, speaking with the dead and learning what it can before fully consuming the body. Like a scholar devouring knowledge from a book, a cynosphinx pores over both the physical and intellectual particulars of its strange corpse diet.  When a cynosphinx it sees fit to mate-usually once its will to live ends-it needs a gynosphinx, just like other sphinxes do. However, due to the cynosphinx's disdain for mating, not to mention gynosphinxes' utter disgust toward cynosphinxes, this type of union is rare. In nearly every case, the resulting offspring from such a pairing is a cynosphinx. Gynosphinxes want nothing to do with such offspring, and offer no protest when the cynosphinx takes the progeny away. Before it dies, the new father brings the child to its lair, leaving its progeny a carcass to learn from and feed upon.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Cynosphinxes dwell among the abandoned burial sites of civilized folk. Due to their obsession with lost secrets and their steady diet of carrion, a cynosphinx's ideal lair is a graveyard, tomb, or necropolis. When a cynosphinx takes up residence at such a site, the otherwise contemplative creature defends its territory with tenacity. However, if a visitor approaches a cynosphinx's territory with the promise of divulging secret lore, the sphinx may grant an audience. In such an instance, if the promise of lore fails to satisfy the cynosphinx, the intruder finds herself quickly under attack. Fortunately, many tombs and necropolises have tight nooks and narrow crannies far too small for a cynosphinx to maneuver in. If a clever traveler offers to explore these regions for the obsessive cynosphinx, she may find this arrangement to be just the bartering chip she needs to leave the sphinx's territory alive.  Solitary by nature, a cynosphinx truly feels comfortable only among the dead, and leaves its lair only for brief, localized patrols or when a longer journey promises to unearth lost knowledge. Cynosphinxes are always male and treat other sphinxes as inferior, save for androsphinxes. Cynosphinxes ignore criosphinxes, subjugate hieracosphinxes, and only associate with gynosphinxes for the purpose of mating-an act cynosphinxes find revolting. If a cynosphinx finds its only recourse to extend its legacy is through mating, this is usually done through blackmailing a gynosphinx or resorting to other forms of coercion or subterfuge. In fact, a cynosphinx would rather discover a means of extending its own lifespan than sire an offspring-as they view even their own progeny as threats to their well-guarded store of knowledge. Toward the androsphinx, the cynosphinx harbors a seething jealousy. Envious of the androsphinx's superior intellect, wisdom, and guile, a cynosphinx will plot to murder any androsphinx it discovers. Cynosphinxes believe they can extract a wealth of knowledge and learn powerful secrets from the carcass of a slaughtered androsphinx using their <i>speak with dead</i> ability. If a cynosphinx's food supply is abundant, the one category of creatures with whom it will ally is the undead. It is common for a cynosphinx to take a place at the head of an undead menace or even to serve a greater power such as a graveknight or a lich.  <br /><strong>Cynosphinxes as Mounts<br /></strong> Although they have the physical ability to carry a rider, cynosphinxes cannot be trained as mounts. They are intelligent beings who choose for themselves whether to accept a rider. A worthy rider is usually a powerful undead creature of evil alignment with whom the cynosphinx has an obsession, or who has promised eldritch secrets in return for service. Often, a creature petitioning a cynosphinx for this arrangement must provide such knowledge regularly for the cynosphinx to continue to grant its consent as a steed. A cynosphinx is considered a special cohort, not a normal mount.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Mummys_Mask.jpg","_id":"z8Nk7I9ZbPLefVO5"}
