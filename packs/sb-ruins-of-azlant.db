Every creature within this area must succeed at a DC 23 Fortitude save each round or lose the ability to breathe air (but gain the ability to breathe water) for 24 hours. Renewed contact with this mucus cloud and failing another save  extends the effect for another 24 hours. The save DC is Constitution-based.  </p><p><strong>Psychic Spike (Su)</strong> Each time a plizeazoth hits a creature with a tentacle attack, it releases a mental spike that embeds itself in the target's psyche. A plizeazoth can maintain a maximum number of spikes equal to the plizeazoth's Hit Dice (15 for a normal plizeazoth). A psychic spike remains embedded in the target's mind for 1 hour, until it is detonated or until the target and the plizeazoth move more than 100 feet from one another. As a swift action, the plizeazoth can detonate any number of its own psychic spikes within 100 feet, dealing 1d6 points of nonlethal damage and 1d2 points of Wisdom damage per detonated psychic spike. The target can attempt a DC 25 Will saving throw once per detonation (not per spike) to halve the nonlethal damage and negate the Wisdom damage. This is a mind-affecting, pain effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Slime (Ex)</strong> A creature hit by a plizeazoth's natural attacks must succeed at a DC 23 Fortitude save or have its skin and flesh transform into a clear, slimy membrane over the course of 1d4 rounds. The creature's new flesh is soft and tender, reducing its Constitution score by 4 as long as the condition persists. If the creature's flesh isn't kept moist, it dries quickly and the creature takes 1d12 points of damage every 10 minutes. <i>Remove disease</i> and similar effects can restore an afflicted creature to normal, but immunity to disease offers no protection from this attack. The save DC is Constitution-based.  </p><p><strong>Tentacles (Ex)</strong> A plizeazoth treats its tentacles as primary natural attacks.</p></div><br /><div><h4><p></p><p>One of the largest alghollthus, the raylike plizeazoths are merciless predators that torment their victims' minds, breaking them for impending service to other alghollthus. Plizeazoths rely on their primal instincts rather than intelligence to complete their tasks. Despite their powerful mental and psychological talents, many plizeazoths do not comprehend the true power they have, long ago bred into a life of subservience to their veiled master overlords. For millennia, the veiled masters subjugated their humanoid victims themselves, but eventually they decided to delegate this joyous yet time-consuming task to others. The veiled masters approached their ancient alghollthu rulers and requested subservient creatures to complete this task. The resulting plizeazoths were impressive in their physical might and ability to efficiently deal pain, but they were immune to such sensations themselves and thus unable to truly comprehend their value within alghollthu society. The brutish beasts are generally content to carry out their masters' orders, with little  will of their own or motivation for them to break from their monotonous existence.  Because they generally do not leave the alghollthus' deep underwater territories- and even then only to carry out specific orders given to them by the society's true masterminds- plizeazoths are largely unknown among land-dwelling cultures. Even their victims recall only their pain and suffering, with at best foggy recollections of their tormentors; the emotional and psychic scars left on their minds scour away all memory of the creatures. The rare victim who escapes a plizeazoth with her mind and memories intact recounts brutal assaults to her psyche, breaking down her reality into a twisted landscape of pain and <i><i>crushing</i> despair</i>, the only escape from which, she believed, was eternal servitude to the plizeazoth's master.  A plizeazoth has five ruby-red eyes, each capable of moving on its own, providing it a wide field of vision and excellent perceptive skills. Plizeazoths are bottom-feeders and, when not tormenting victims, typically scour the ocean floors for other alghollthus' scraps. A typical plizeazoth is about 22 feet wide and weighs approximately 4,400 pounds.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Plizeazoths have wide, dark-teal fins that allow them to move stealthily through deep waters. Each plizeazoth has a tentacle on each side of its wide sucking mouth, which it uses both as a natural weapon and to manipulate tools and its environment in the rare event it needs to do either. A plizeazoth's hardened scabrous tail can likewise be employed as a weapon, but the alghollthu lacks the dexterity to do more than simply slam it broadly into an enemy. A plizeazoth's body is malleable, which allows it to easily squeeze into tight caverns and small structures. This also allows it to make subtle alterations to its normal raylike form, moving its vital organs around to accommodate a number of different configurations.  Savage in its telepathic and mental prowess, a plizeazoth's only desires are to defend itself from would-be attackers or brutally subjugate its victims in the name of its veiled master overlords. Plizeazoths are skilled at using emotion, hallucination, and pain to their advantage; they make quick work of weak-minded foes but take particular pleasure in whittling down determined, willful enemies. After its victim has been sufficiently broken, a plizeazoth quickly moves on to its next task, ever eager to please its superiors.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  In alghollthu society, plizeazoths have little status and keep to themselves until summoned by their masters. Other alghollthus look down on the creatures, judging them as primitive and thus unpredictable, keeping their distance merely as a precaution. In general, only its master will approach a plizeazoth, and then only to issue new commands to the servant; commands are generally very basic and easy for the plizeazoth to understand, even if the creature's actions may be part of much larger, more complex plots.  Plizeazoths are kept as something akin to pets by their masters, and the massive brutes rarely stray far from underwater alghollthu cities unless dispatched on a specific task that sends them farther afield. Plizeazoths don't typically create homes or lairs for themselves, and the creatures are content to simply graze near deep trenches for food until they receive a telepathic command that spurs them into action. Plizeazoths are usually solitary creatures, but if the need arises, the veiled masters have been known to give a pair a mission and instructions to cooperate in carrying it out.  In their current subservient state, plizeazoths obey their veiled masters without question and pose little threat to creatures they have not been expressly instructed to attack. With years of evolution, however, plizeazoths that gain self-awareness and an increased intellect could become a threat even to other alghollthus. This concern does not distress their mysterious rulers, however, as they already have plans in motion for when that time comes.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Ruins_of_Azlant.jpg","_id":"0O5mo285DpNXv2AP"}

Such a soul lingers around the detritus of a shipwreck, eventually coalescing into a flotsam terror. Multiple terrors can spawn from one wreck. They then ride the currents, roaming the seas until they locate other ships. Flotsam terrors are malicious and bitter entities, detesting their fate and intentionally seeking out ships in hopes of causing additional wrecks. The creatures follow and attack any survivors, intent on creating more of their kind.  A flotsam terror is typically 3 feet tall and weighs up to 50 pounds.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Although they usually form around shipwrecks, flotsam terrors aren't created after the sinking of every ship. The souls that linger to eventually become flotsam terrors are usually already filled with spite. Many flotsam terrors are born after a failed mutiny causes a ship to crash, when the remaining traitorous souls are reborn with vindictive fervor. Not all flotsam terrors share this origin, however. Some are born from the souls of casual travelers who believe themselves unfairly slain, usually due to the actions of the ship's captain or crew. Rather than attacking ships in general, these flotsam terrors seek out surviving crew members in hopes of revenge.  A flotsam terror's composition is peculiar. Each has the ability to undo itself, reverting into a floating mass of debris and seaweed. In this state, the terror is virtually indistinguishable from actual flotsam, and the component parts of its form are surprisingly interchangeable: multiple flotsam terrors can exchange and share various pieces of debris, trading parts of their bodies with every discorporation. Flotsam terrors can also intertwine and mingle while dispersed in this manner, forming sizable masses of debris called floats.  Flotsam terrors spend most of their time at sea. Occasionally, the pursuit of a specific target causes a flotsam terror to move onto land. A flotsam terror is hindered when out of the water, as the thick, waterlogged mass of its body weighs it down. On land, the terror usually discorporates to appear as a pile of flotsam that washed up on shore. A flotsam terror is incredibly patient and will remain in this form for days or even weeks, waiting for a creature to investigate its presence on the shore, at which point the flotsam attacks.  On rare occasions, a flotsam terror forms from the remains of previously slain flotsam terrors. Sometimes a single piece of a destroyed flotsam terror will slip away, holding a spark of its animating force. When enough of these lone pieces come together, they create a more powerful form of a flotsam terror. Known as flotsam  fiends, these terrors have the advanced and giant creature simple templates. A flotsam fiend's increased intelligence allows it to speak and recall an original purpose; thus, a flotsam fiend often strives to fulfill the original intent of its most dominant soul. Flotsam fiends can hold dominion over large numbers of flotsam terrors, allowing them to draw small armies to their causes.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Flotsam terrors generally travel near coasts where they can attack ships early in their journey. This also allows the creatures to more easily destroy ships by leading them toward dangerous reefs or cliffs. Those formed far out at sea tend to remain in their dispersed form for weeks, allowing the currents to draw them closer to civilization. In the rare case that a flotsam terror encounters a ship while out at sea, it often attaches to the hull until the ship returns to dock, then attacks disembarking sailors, or it finds a suitable location to try to sink the ship.  Flotsam terrors generally lack any kind of personality. When first created, a flotsam terror is filled with specific purpose, usually the destruction of an individual whom the terror believes wronged it in life. This purpose is quickly lost, however. When flotsam terrors disperse and intermingle, they mix not only their debris but also their intelligence and memories. This leads flotsam terrors traveling in groups to eventually share a similar, but diminished purpose. While not precisely a hive mind, these groups move and attack with complicated tactics, a byproduct of their shared semiconsciousness.  A float of flotsam terrors behaves differently if led by a flotsam fiend. Such floats still attack ships in large groups, but their attacks are more deliberate. A fiend with a particularly tactical soul, such as that of a captain or naval general, is a force to be reckoned with.  A fiend that succeeds at its primary goal usually surrenders its position and its power by intentionally discorporating among its fellow terrors. When it reforms, the fiend has a new dominant soul, meaning a flotsam fiend never lacks a purpose. This allows a float to maintain a never-ending crusade, continually adding more flotsam terrors to its ranks. This process is of particular note to scholars, as undead creatures are rarely so prone to cooperating with one another. Whether this is an instinctive response or a sign of the various souls finding camaraderie in their misery has yet to be seen.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Ruins_of_Azlant.jpg","_id":"2jyfZ8VTFhd1JIcU"}

Any creature within this aura is affected as if by <i>slow</i>, but it gets no saving throw. If a creature exits the radius, the effect ceases at the end of its turn.

From the creature's perspective, the time shift is instantaneous. Any duration effects active upon the creature become suspended during the time shift, resuming when the creature reappears. Creatures that succeed at their saving throws cannot be affected by the same fluxwraith's time shift ability for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p></div><br /><div><h4><p></p><p>A fluxwraith is an incorporeal undead with a host of extraordinary powers owing to its singular status as a time-displaced entity. Its serene appearance and dreamlike demeanor harken to its origins, for in life it slept away the centuries in a state of magical or technological stasis. Now, whether by accident or malign intent, the fluxwraith's soul lies scattered across the timestream. Demented by its paradoxical consciousness, it yearns to destroy any living being audacious enough to exist within a single point of time.  Because its appearance depends upon its state when it first entered suspended animation, viewers may sometimes be able to deduce clues about its former life, as well as its motivations for entering hibernation. Some seek interminable sleep while they are in the prime of life, aiming to awaken and embrace immortality as a perfect specimen, while others hope to defer a terminal diagnosis. However, the sleeper's motivations in life seldom define a fluxwraith's outlook, as the process of becoming undead erases all but the most deeply ingrained mortal traits.  The first hint of the fluxwraith's destructive nature manifests in the caul of energy that winks on and off around it. This ever-shifting network of temporal energy contains fragments of its consciousness, appearing as flickering aspects of itself as a youth, an adult, or a corpse. Scrutinizing these vignettes may provide further clues about the fluxwraith's former existence, although any creature that enters the fluxwraith's aura, or any creature affected by its attacks, may begin to see its own reflections appear within the shards as well. These disturbing images depict a creature not as it is, but as the fluxwraith perceives it in the past or future.  Fluxwraiths tend to speak ancient or dead languages, often murmuring incomplete or garbled statements that blend past and future tenses in unsettling ways.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  While some sages seek to cheat mortality through necromancy, others use potent temporal magic or even cryogenic technology to survive the eons, aspiring to awaken in a future when death has been rendered obsolete. Yet <i>temporal stasis</i> carries many risks, and any damage to the sleeper's pod may kill its inhabitant, or worse. Some types of malfunctions kill the sleeper's physical body but scatter its awareness across the timestream, causing its consciousness to exist in every moment at once. This process shreds the sleeper's sanity but imbues its spirit with terrifying temporal powers, resulting in a fluxwraith.  The malfunction also causes most fluxwraiths to lose the skills and abilities they had in life. They do retain a sharp intellect, although they see the world through a distorted lens of madness, malice, and heightened temporal awareness. A fluxwraith perceives living creatures as knotted threads of time-bound energy begging to be untied and twisted into more pleasing patterns, and it revels in its capacity to shift victims through time or even freeze them for eternity.  Occasionally, a demented spellcaster may purposely create a fluxwraith seeking to harness temporal power for her own use. In such cases, the sleeper is usually tricked into entering its slumber with promises of immortality, after which its malice and fury are only increased by the betrayal. A fluxwraith does not remain subservient to any master, and it invariably overpowers its creator.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Though no one knows why, fluxwraiths rarely drift far from the damaged sleeping chambers that spawned them. Some might harbor an unconscious hope that their pods might be repaired, enabling them to return to a more peaceful time-bound sleep; others might simply feel no need for physical movement, since their minds now roam unfettered through the timestream.  A fluxwraith may prefer solitude, attacking intruders on sight. Others relish the chance to toy with visitors before severing them from the timestream. An ambitious fluxwraith might employ underlings to  kidnap living beings, providing it with a steady stream of organic \"puzzles\" to unravel. Occasionally, a system-wide malfunction results in the creation of several fluxwraiths at once. These clusters become monomaniacal, plotting to spread their influence far beyond their lair. Using tantalizing glimpses of the future, they entice evil mortals or lesser undead to scour the world for time-based artifacts in order to vastly boost the range of their innate abilities.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Ruins_of_Azlant.jpg","_id":"4eh1b9MR2UI2Zvi6"}

A clockwork nautiloid resembles an oversized  nautilus with a curved and magically strengthened shell. Its sharp, octopus-like beak is surrounded by dozens of tentacles that appear organic but contain rotors and pistons allowing for a strong, prehensile grip. Most of its tentacles end in a subtly serrated gripping pad, but two of them end in specialized sensory equipment shielded with durable crystal. These clusters provide the clockwork nautiloid with superior senses, allowing it to see even in the oppressive blackness of the deep ocean.  Clockwork nautiloids pursue the directives of their creators with single-minded purpose, attacking any creature that interferes with their orders. Although a clockwork nautiloid has many gripping tentacles, it can usually bring only four of these tentacles to bear in combat along with its snapping bite. Clockwork nautiloids are relentless combatants that pursue their opponents to any depth and even onto land, propelling themselves with their powerful tentacles.  A clockwork nautiloid is 30 feet long and weighs 4 tons.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  The shell of a clockwork nautiloid is a tight spiral made of overlapping metal plates. In addition to providing significant protection to the creature's delicate internal mechanisms, this shell is coated with a thin film of grease baked onto the metal at incredible temperatures to waterproof the creature's interior and prevent the shell from degrading in the harsh, salty water of the ocean. This thin film also reflects incoming rays, scattering these magical attacks without harm to the clockwork nautiloid.  Unlike with living nautiluses, which inhabit only the largest portions of their shells as they grow, a clockwork nautiloid's entire spiraled shell is filled with gears, rods, and springs. The pleasing logarithmic spiral of a clockwork nautiloid's shell arises not from a pattern of natural growth but because the mathematically consistent shape allows for the most efficient packing of the creature's clockworks. A clockwork nautiloid's winding key fits into a small hole at the precise center of its spiraled shell, on either the left or right side.  Although clockwork nautiloids have few natural predators, mysterious titanic creatures lurk in the deep oceans, and clockwork engineers often camouflage their clockwork nautiloids just to be safe. The upper side of a clockwork nautiloid is often constructed of dark metals in overlapping stripes, allowing the clockwork nautiloid to blend with the deeper ocean below when it is seen from above. Similarly, the creature's underside is usually constructed of bright, pale metals; when seen from below, the creature appears part of the brighter ocean above. Clockwork nautiloids cannot retract into their shells, although they can fold their tentacles over each other to form a rigid covering.  Tons of ore are required to produce a clockwork nautiloid-enough to deplete a small mine-but once created, the construct has little impact upon the natural environment. Its coated shells provide no purchase for barnacles or other small creatures, so it slips through the seas without displacing marine life. A clockwork nautiloid pollutes very little under normal operation, as its greased gears and pumps are fully contained.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  As they are specifically created to withstand marine depths, clockwork nautiloids are only rarely found outside of the deep ocean. Because of the expense of creating these constructs, they are usually programmed to perform specific, important tasks lasting no more than 22 days (the limit of the clockwork nautiloid's winding). The tasks that bring clockwork nautiloids to the ocean depths are as varied as the motives of their creators. A creator might deploy a clockwork nautiloid to defend a strategic undersea locale, recover treasures from a shipwreck, explore a submerged ruin, or capture valuable marine specimens.  Clockwork nautiloids must be flexible problem solvers, as they usually operate independently in environments that would be lethal to their creators. Like most clockwork constructs, clockwork nautiloids lack an Intelligence score, but each is constructed with multiple internal turning scripts that turn simultaneously when wound. As a result, clockwork nautiloids can process multiple strategies to surmount obstacles. This parallel thinking also makes a clockwork nautiloid a surprisingly flexible combatant, able to efficiently fight large groups by grappling smaller foes, biting at others, and rotating its thick shell to intercept attacks.  Few clockwork engineers have the resources necessary to build more than one clockwork nautiloid at a time, but those who do find that the creatures work very well when paired together. Although a clockwork nautiloid's tentacles cannot normally reach its own key (unless its tentacles are specifically designed to do so), clockwork nautiloids can wind each other to extend their operating time considerably. Undersea explorers tell of roving pairs of clockwork nautiloids encountered many leagues from civilization, sustaining each other for much longer than their initial winding.  <br /><strong>Variant Clockwork</strong><br /> Nautiloids Just like other clockwork creatures, clockwork nautiloids can be found in many configurations, each  specific to the construct's task. Furthermore, clockwork engineers can retrofit and redesign existing clockwork nautiloids to serve different functions. One of the many variant clockwork nautiloids is presented below.  <br /><strong>Kolgo's Submersible (CR 14):</strong> The gnome engineer \"Cogwheel\" Kolgo spent his life's fortune in the construction of a clockwork nautiloid with an internal chamber just large enough for a Small humanoid to inhabit. A creature in the chamber can wind Kolgo's submersible and see out of the construct's prehensile eyestalks.

Ages ago, Azlanti sorcerers employed these serpents to guard their sanctums and vaults. Over the millennia since Earthfall, mirror serpents have grown feral and fiercely territorial. Because they lack the ability to reproduce and grow their number, mirror serpents are quite rare. The arcane knowledge of their creation rituals hasn't resurfaced in the current age; if anyone has discovered it, they have kept it a closely guarded secret. Most surviving mirror serpents reside within the ruins of Azlant, staying near the places they were once tasked to guard. Their original purpose as sentinels has imprinted on them a fascination for treasure. Mirror serpents typically live several centuries, unless they suffer a violent fate, but death does not necessarily spell an end to their existence, which is a constant cycle of death and rebirth. Mirror serpents grow much larger and wiser as they age beyond their first century.  A mirror serpent's body stretches out to a length of 15 feet and weighs 400 pounds.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Unlike most other creatures, mirror serpents don't permanently die unless their remains are purposefully destroyed to prevent rebirth. Each mirror serpent carries within its body an egg that holds the seed of its next life and matures along with its natural aging. If a mirror serpent dies prematurely, the egg within it simply decays along with the rest of the creature's internal organs. When a mirror serpent dies of natural causes, however, its soft tissue is absorbed into the egg as a final act of fertilization, leaving the egg amid the hollow husk of the serpent's reflective skin. Water is the most ideal location for the egg's 13-month incubation to take place, and thus when dying, most mirror serpents head for the nearest large body of water. The egg has an exceptionally hard, crystalline shell that protects it from predatory fauna and other dangers while it incubates. Additionally, shortly after an egg is fertilized, it becomes naturally invisible as a defense mechanism. If the egg remains intact, it eventually hatches, releasing a young mirror serpent into its predecessor's territory. While the newborn mirror serpent has its own personality, some echoes remain of the previous incarnation, such as intuitions on safe and dangerous areas nearby and an instinctual gravitation toward its old lair.  While mirror serpents resemble snakes in many regards, their snouts are elongated and toothy, like the face of a gharial, and pair of crystalline horns crowns their brows. The reflective sheen of a mirror serpent's  scales can be quite dazzling in bright sunlight as it dives into or leaps out of water, chasing birds and fish with equal prowess. The structure of a mirror serpent's scales resembles that of actual glazed mirrors, making the creatures vulnerable to sonic attacks. Mirror serpent flesh is hardy and resembles cloudy glass, and they bleed slightly luminescent blue liquid when they're wounded.  Mirror serpents' primary diet consists of amphibian and avian animals that live in or near their territories, though they are typically not opposed to eating those humanoids foolish enough to blunder into their domains, especially if the mirror serpent guards treasure of particular power, secrecy, or value. These serpents rarely fight to the death unless they feel there's no other choice. One function of their hunting is to keep major predators away from their territory so that when the mirror serpent dies, its egg has a better chance of surviving its incubation period. Mirror serpents use their natural invisibility when investigating whether creatures are food or a threat. When they choose to fight, mirror serpents make sudden attacks and retreats, turning invisible in order to hide their movements and strike from a new vantage point. They use their savage bites to separate their foes and attempt to fling them into water, where the serpents can take advantage of their superior mobility.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Most mirror serpents lair near or within ancient Azlanti ruins so they can seek out and collect treasures and trinkets that lie forgotten among Earthfall's devastation. Each lair is usually located near a body of water, and its opening is most likely overlooking or hiding below the water's surface. A common place for a den is on the side of a natural cliff or a part of a ruined tower that has no other access points. Even when the entrance is below the surface, the actual living area is situated above water level. When in their lairs, mirror serpents lie curled in the center, while their treasure is spread against the surrounding walls. Not all of the treasure-or even most of it-is of actual monetary value, since items need only to gleam and be beautiful to catch the attention of the serpents. Mirrored scales, or even a complete husk, are often found among the piled treasure as the newest incarnation has dragged the glittering remains of the previous mirror serpent into the lair.  Mirror serpents hate creatures that defile nature or deface structures within their domain, causing them to become violent from the outset. It's possible to communicate with mirror serpents by speaking Azlanti; the knowledge of that language was imbued in the creatures during the ritual of their creation and remains with them through each rebirth. Once a person  has entered the territory of a mirror serpent, there's a small window of opportunity to speak up in order to keep it from attacking and driving the intruder away. An offering of treasure or ornate trinkets goes a long way toward appeasing a mirror serpent to allow swift safe passage through its domain. If the territories of two mirror serpents are adjacent to each other, minor clashes may arise between the two beasts. Such fights rarely lead to death, as one them eventually yields to the more powerful rival, accepting defeat over endangering even its greatest enemy's cycle of rebirth.  Mirror serpent scales are a valued material for those who craft magical armor. With proper techniques, it's possible to forge a suit of scale mail that retains a portion of the spell-reflecting ability that mirror serpents have. If a person comes upon a mirror serpent egg, she can attempt to train the newly hatched serpent and turn it into a guardian or a companion. However, the echoes of lifetimes it has spent free in the wild make this a challenge.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Ruins_of_Azlant.jpg","_id":"Ci1xgSr8KNWSLv32"}

A secondary discharge arcs off each target that fails its save, striking the nearest creature within 30 feet as long as that creature has not already been targeted by the breath weapon or another discharge. Secondary discharges do not cause tertiary discharges. The bioelectricity overwhelms the nervous systems of living creatures, causing any living creature that takes damage from the linnorm's breath weapon to be stunned for  rounds. A successful DC 34 Fortitude saving throw negates the stunning effect. Creatures struck by a secondary discharge receive a +4 bonus on this saving throw. The save DC is Constitution-based.  </p><p><strong>Death Curse (Su)</strong> When a creature slays a sea linnorm, the slayer is affected by the curse of crushing depths.  <i>Curse of Crushing</i> <i>Depths</i>: save Will DC 32; effect creature takes 3d6 points of damage every round while fully submerged in water, as though suffering water pressure damage, regardless of the creature's actual depth and bypassing any magical protection against water pressure (such as <i>freedom of movement</i> or <i>life</i> bubbleAPG). The save DC is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Lure (Su)</strong> As a free action, a sea linnorm can light the dangling lures on its head; any other creature within a 120-foot radius that can see the lure must succeed at a DC 32 Will save or become fascinated for 1 round. In addition to the regular effects of being fascinated, a creature affected by this ability also takes a -4 penalty on saving throws against the sea linnorm's breath weapon. Regardless of the preceding interactions between the sea linnorm and its target, a creature affected by this ability does not view the sea linnorm who has fascinated it as a potential threat until that sea linnorm actually attacks-allowing it to approach without breaking the fascination effect. Once a creature succeeds at its saving throw against this effect, it is immune to the same sea linnorm's lure ability for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Poison (Ex)</strong> Bite-injury; <i>save</i> Fort DC 34; <i>frequency</i> 1/round for 10 rounds; <i>effect</i> 8d8 points of electricity damage, 1d6 Dex drain, and 1d6 Con drain; <i>cure</i> 3 consecutive <i>save</i>s.</p></div><br /><div><h4><p></p><p>Few, if any, linnorm breeds are more reclusive than the sea linnorm. These immense specimens of primeval draconic lineage dwell in the deepest underwater trenches of the world, blending into their surroundings thanks to their darkened scales. A sea linnorm's distinctive facial lures attract all manner of sea <i>life</i>, which the linnorm promptly feasts upon before returning to its lair. Luckily for all nonaquatic civilizations, sea linnorms rarely leave the ocean depths they call home.  A typical sea linnorm grows up to 55 feet long and weighs around 14,000 pounds. It is believed that sea linnorms are effectively immortal, with the oldest recorded sea linnorms surviving well over 5,000 years.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Electricity courses through a sea linnorm's body. The linnorm uses this internally generated power to fuel both its facial lures and, when necessary, its devastating breath weapon. This natural attack manifests as a powerful line of orange bioelectricity that overwhelms  the nervous system of any living creature in its path. The innate bioelectrical energy of creatures struck by the breath weapon further empower the attack, creating additional discharges that arc off the breath weapon's naturally straight trajectory toward the nearest living creature. When the linnorm uses this attack to hunt larger underwater creatures, the subsequent discharges quickly overwhelm entire schools of fish for the sea linnorm to devour.  Luckily for the surface world, sea linnorms rarely have any reason to depart their deep underwater homes. Teeming schools of aquatic megafauna roam in the depths that sea linnorms inhabit. This primordial wild<i>life</i> is of such size that a waking sea linnorm rarely concerns itself with having to roam far for a fulfilling meal. After eating, a sea linnorm hibernates for years, or even centuries, at a time. In some instances, entire aquatic settlements spring to <i>life</i> near the hidden lair of a sea linnorm, only to incur the beast's excessive wrath when it awakens from its slumber. Some of these unfortunately placed settlements even adjust their entire societies to provide for \"their\" linnorms, shepherding schools of fish toward the beasts' lairs and, in harder times, encouraging visitors to visit the linnorms' dens.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Sea linnorms inhabit the deepest trenches of the world's oceans. Only the abundance of large underwater <i>life</i> sustains the voracious appetites of the bioelectrically charged beasts. As a result, a sea linnorm's perceived territory encompasses a space of several thousand square miles. Any sentient creature that the sea linnorm perceives as a threat is sought out and slain. Those few settlements permitted to exist within a sea linnorm's domain are used as early warning systems; each settlement is seeded with traditions of alerting the great linnorm to the presence of potentially threatening outsiders or of certain types of aquatic alpha-predator <i>life</i>-forms, such as krakens, luscas, or sea serpents. A sea linnorm immediately seeks out intruders, recognizing that it will either triumph or die-better to be slain fighting in the open water than cornered in its lair.  Few mortals know of the existence of sea linnorms, let alone hunt these ancient creatures. The sole recorded instance of a successfully slain sea linnorm was by the Linnorm King Elgar Fahrstad. As the king crossed the Arcadian Ocean on his way to the mystical paradise of Valenhall, Fahrstad is said to have leapt without uttering a word from the side of his longship into the depths of the ocean. For 3 days and 3 nights, his entourage waited. On daybreak of the fourth day, Elgar Fahrstad emerged from the sea, accompanied by a ride of eight valkyries and the severed head of a sea linnorm. A half-dozen skalds departed the expedition, forsaking the paradise of Valenhall so they could return to the Lands of the Linnorm Kings and retell the final journey of King Fahrstad.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Ruins_of_Azlant.jpg","_id":"HLjxYO7Sau8MAgtZ"}

On a hit, the target's immunity to mind-affecting effects is completely suppressed as long as it remains within 50 feet of the enisysian (no save).  </p><p><strong>Mental Disarmament (Su)</strong> An enisysian emits a constant telepathic barrage that lowers the mental defenses of nearby creatures. Anyone within 100 feet of an enisysian must succeed at a DC 17 Will saving throw or take a -4 penalty on Will saving throws while in range. A creature that succeeds at this saving throw is immune  to the enisysian's mental disarmament for 24 hours. The enisysian and any creature bonded with it via its symbiotic bond are immune to this ability. An enisysian can suppress or reactivate this ability as a swift action. Mental disarmament is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Wisdom-based.  </p><p><strong>Mucus Cloud (Ex)</strong> An underwater enisysian exudes a cloud of clear slime extending 5 feet from itself in all directions. Any creature in this area must succeed at a DC 14 Fortitude saving throw each round or it loses its ability to breathe air (but gains the ability to breathe water) for 24 hours. Renewed contact with the mucus cloud and failing another saving throw extends the effect for another 24 hours. An enisysian can suppress or reactivate this ability as a swift action. The save DC is Constitution-based.  </p><p><strong>Slime (Ex)</strong> A creature hit by an enisysian's tentacles must succeed at a DC 14 Fortitude saving throw or have its flesh and skin transform into a clear, slimy membrane over the course of 1d4 rounds. The creature's new flesh is soft and tender, reducing its Constitution score by 4 as long as the condition persists. If the creature's flesh isn't kept moist, it dries quickly and the victim takes 1d12 points of damage every 10 minutes. <i>Remove disease</i> and similar effects can restore an afflicted creature to normal, but immunity to disease offers no protection from this attack. The save DC is Constitution-based.  </p><p><strong>Symbiotic Bond (Su)</strong> An enisysian is able to form a symbiotic bond with another willing, living creature. This amplifies the host creature's mental abilities and boosts its ability to control others. To do this, the enisysian must successfully grapple the target, after which, instead of pinning or maintaining the grapple, it can burrow into the skin as a standard action that deals 10 points of damage; this damage cannot be healed until the enisysian detaches or dies. If the host is Large or larger, the enisysian (but not the host) is considered to have the grappled condition while thus attached. If the host is Medium or smaller, both are considered to have the grappled condition while attached. Over the next 24 hours the enisysian and the host form a mental and mystical bond, after which the host gains the following bonuses: a +2 enhancement bonus to its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, and a +2 bonus to the caster level and DC of spells and spell-like abilities with the mind-affecting descriptor.</p></div><br /><div><h4><p></p><p>Of all the races of alghollthus, none are as poorly understood by the scholars of the surface world as the enisysians. Their very existence is only a rumor, kept a closely guarded secret by an elite group of veiled masters known as the Fifth Dictum. These individuals coexist with enisysians in an asymmetrical physical and  psychic symbiosis. In exchange for their protection, the much weaker enisysians grant their veiled master hosts not only increased mental capacity but also the ability to use their powers to influence other alghollthus. This relationship is far from equal, however, as the enisysians have been bred to be subservient to their masters for thousands of years, directly in opposition to the second dictum of their people: an alghollthu is to control. It should therefore never be controlled. Members of the Fifth Dictum rightly fear that should it become known that they created a race of alghollthu slaves, their kind would quickly turn against them.  Enisysians were first created during the Age of Darkness from aboleth stock by the Fifth Dictum as a response to the cataclysm of Earthfall. These veiled masters had been vocal opponents of the human experiment (as they called the Azlanti civilization) from the beginning, believing that the humanoids were too free willed and unpredictable to be of lasting use. The destruction that Earthfall caused not only to the surface races but also to the alghollthu civilization at the time confirmed their worst fears. In the ruins of their broken cities, the Fifth Dictum began secretly fleshwarping the enisysians in order to give themselves the power to intervene against their own kin and prevent such a disastrous decision from ever being made again. Over the following millennia, however, members of the Fifth Dictum have grown arrogant, and they now believe themselves to be the true masters of alghollthu culture.  A typical enisysian is about 3 feet in length and weighs approximately 40 pounds.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  An enisysian appears as a small tentlike creature with gray skin and trailing tentacles that end in small hooks. Its upper body resembles that of a jellyfish, but with three large, lidless eyes with vertical black pupils arrayed in a line. On the underside of its body is a small double-hooked beak used for eating and attaching to its host. While on land, four of its tentacles act as legs while two of them are used for defense or to manipulate tools. In the water, the enisysian propels itself with its tentacles like a squid.  An enisysian is custom-bred to serve a single veiled master for its life. Like other alghollthus, an enisysian is basically immortal, able to repair almost any damage to its body over time or even enter a chrysalis state to wholly regenerate itself. Designed and bred to be subservient, an enisysian allows itself to be attached to the underside of its veiled master host at a young age. Once the bond between the alghollthus forms, the enisysian disguises its shape to appear as a remora  or any other species of suckerfish common in its biome, reverting to its true shape only when it dies. It remains attached throughout its life, drawing its nutrition from the veiled master's blood and by filtering micronutrients from the water around it.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Until very recently, enisysians have had no cultural or even personal identity separate from that of the veiled masters they served. Genetically bred for dedication and obedience, they communicated telepathically only with their bonded veiled masters, not even acknowledging others of their kind. This has begun to change over the last several centuries, as natural genetic mutations have decreased the enisysians' inbred subservience and enhanced their self-awareness. Individual enisysians have begun to secretly communicate with one another, slowly awakening others of their kind to their enslavement while reaching out to alghollthus beyond their masters' control for support. Although the process of their emancipation has been very slow due to the Fifth Dictum's paranoia and secrecy, knowledge of their existence has begun to spread among the other alghollthu races, and surface-dwelling scholars have even theorized about the existence of the enisysians in certain works.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Ruins_of_Azlant.jpg","_id":"MBajtWNF62fY8sPb"}

Creatures caught in this cone take 2d4 points of acid damage on the first round of exposure, and 1d4 points of acid damage on the second round. With a successful Reflex saving throw, a target halves the damage and negates the second round of damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.</p></div><br /><div><h4><p></p><p>Long before the aboleths uplifted humanity, these deep-sea-dwelling entities experimented on other aquatic life forms, perfecting the art of genetic manipulation and developing entities that would become their unyielding servants. The creatures known as chuuls today (a derivation of their alghollthu name, \"chu'ulothis\") were little more than aggressive crustaceans prior to aboleth meddling. Only after successive generations of guided evolution were chuuls transformed into the hulking monstrosities they are today, and their keen intelligence likewise came from their aboleth masters' uplifting.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  The larval form of a chuul most closely resembles an oversized lobster. A typical chuul nest usually contains 6-8 rocklike eggs, though only half of the larvae survive hatching, as these vicious creatures' first meals are the weakest of their clutch mates. Upon hatching, a larval chuul lacks the paralytic tendrils and claws of its mature form, but instead has the capability to spray digestive fluid in a wide cone. Larval chuuls predigest their meals and are engineered to crave the cerebral tissue of intelligent creatures.  Only through feeding on the brains of intelligent creatures do chuuls develop their own intelligence and linguistic abilities. A chuul unable to feast on cerebral tissue of a creature with an Intelligence score of 8 or higher within the first year of hatching never becomes a mature chuul, though it continues to grow in size. Larval chuuls can be represented by larval chuuls with the advanced creature and giant creature simple templates. The more intelligent members of  their species loathe these creatures and destroy them whenever they are discovered.  After a yearlong maturation process that requires the larval chuul to digest up to five brains of Medium or larger creatures, the larva undergoes a slow molting process over the course of a month. During this time, the larval chuul grows to Medium size and loses its bite attack. When the chuul sheds its larval carapace, it gains two claw attacks and the paralytic tendrils of its mature form. A lesser chuul's tendrils are fully grown at this stage, though they appear enormous on the lesser chuul's smaller body and allow for surprisingly long reach. A lesser chuul's paralytic secretions are not as strong as the adult form's, but retain some of the acidic qualities of the larval chuul instead. These tendrils are used for capturing and eating prey and for easy access to cerebral tissue (typically acquired by forcing a tendril into an eye socket or nasal cavity). A lesser chuul's appetite for cerebral tissue is largely vestigial at this point in development, and tapers off entirely by the time it reaches maturity.  Two years after its hatching, a lesser chuul enters a second month-long molting stage from which it emerges as a fully grown adult chuul. Due to the relatively slow development cycle of larva to adult (with regard to aboleths' patience), these creatures are often bred in enormous numbers to mitigate any loss of adult chuuls that may be suffered during the service of their deep masters. Rumors persist of deep, calm coves on remote islands that host hundreds of chuul young. If such legends are true, no one has ever survived making such a discovery to report the exact location of their find.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Within aboleth society, chuuls are seen as a slave race and, despite their intelligence, are rarely regarded as more than cattle. The ulat-kini (also known as skum) are the alghollthus' preferred servitor race, and chuuls within aboleth society are brutally conditioned to accept their prescribed inferiority. Outside of aboleth society, chuuls are largely independent and curious creatures with an innate cruelty bred into their species by their aboleth creators. Even larval chuuls have this inherent sense of malice, further developed through inflicting suffering on other sentient creatures.  Rare chuuls that have existed for generations outside of aboleth society may be of chaotic neutral alignment  rather than chaotic evil, though these creatures still require the cerebral tissue of intelligent creatures to develop their own sentience, making a chuul clutch's ultimate shift away from inherently evil tendencies unlikely. Aboleth-serving chuuls typically destroy these independent groups as soon as they are discovered, though some find refuge in the deepest and darkest corners of the oceans of Golarion where not even aboleths tread. These chuuls make alliances with deep merfolk and other inhabitants of the lightless reaches of the deepest oceans.  <strong><strong></strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>Variants</strong></strong></p><p></p><p>  While the majority of all chuuls are represented by the statistics presented in the <i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</i>, some unique variants were created or modified by aboleth masters to serve specific roles in far-reaching plans, or have evolved different physiologies in response to vastly different environments.  <br /><strong>Arctic Chuuls:</strong> Arctic chuuls were designed to inhabit the freezing waters of the Crown of the World. These cold-dwelling creatures have cold resistance 10 and a burrow speed of 20 feet usable only in snow or ice.  <br /><strong>Deep Chuuls:</strong> A deep chuul is dusky gray to midnight blue in coloration and bears a glowing antenna that sheds light like a torch, much like an anglerfish's lure. Deep chuuls can use this light to fascinate creatures as per the <i>hypnotism</i> spell (CL = the chuul's Hit Dice).  <br /><strong>Psychic Chuuls:</strong> Chuuls that feed on the brains of creatures capable of casting psychic magic (see <i>Pathfinder RPG Occult</i> Adventures) sometimes develop inherent psychic magic abilities of their own in the form of spell-like abilities, but they are destroyed on sight by aboleths who encounter them. Rumors persist that psychic chuuls are capable of evolving into a new state beyond that of the adult chuul form.  <br /><strong>Sand Chuuls:</strong> Rarest of all chuul breeds, sand chuuls inhabit parched wastelands and deserts, and were intended to serve as the shock troops of a land invasion force following Earthfall. When the aboleths' plans failed to come to fruition, these specially engineered chuuls were largely forgotten. Now native to blasted regions of Casmaron and southern Garund, sand chuuls lack the aquatic subtype, the amphibious special quality, and a swim speed. Instead, a sand chuul has a burrow speed of 30 feet and tremorsense out to a distance of 30 feet.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Ruins_of_Azlant.jpg","_id":"NarC0TgvRG9MSQ6Z"}

The cloud acts as an <i>obscuring mist</i> spell, but it lasts for 1 round, after which it dissipates. A creature in the cloud when the pollen is released or that moves into the cloud before it dissipates must succeed at a DC 13 Fortitude saving throw or be blinded for 1 round. The saving throw DC is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Change Foliage (Su)</strong> Three times per day as an immediate action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity, a blood maize plant can make itself appear as a different type of plant. This new appearance mimics that of any plant up to two size categories smaller than the blood maize and need not resemble the blood maize's true form. For example, the blood maize can take on the semblance of a pumpkin vine, strawberry plant, or sunflower. A blood maize plant's statistics remain the same, even if it is masquerading as a plant of a smaller size category. It can't assume the form of another plant creature and can imitate only the appearance of plants that are normally considered part of the surrounding terrain. This effect is a visual illusion only and does not alter the perceived scent or tactile properties of the blood maize. While using this ability, the blood maize gains a +10 racial bonus on Stealth checks.  A successful DC 20 Knowledge (nature) or Survival check is required to identify the plant's true nature. A creature that interacts with a blood maize plant while it is using this ability can disbelieve the illusion with a successful DC 13 Will saving throw. Changing back into its true form requires an immediate action. This is an illusion (glamer) effect. The saving throw DC is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Root Deep (Ex)</strong> As a free action that doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity, a blood maize plant can use its long hooklike appendage to root itself deep into dirt or soil, but not into rock or other harder materials. This grants the blood maize a +4 racial bonus against bull rush or trip attempts.</p></div><br /><div><h4><p></p><p>Named not for their physical coloration but for their thirst for spilled blood, the plants known as blood maize plants are insidious creatures. They look like common cornstalks, except their leaves are larger and more knifelike and their root systems are much more robust and mobile. In each specimen, the latter includes at least one long vine-like tendril that the plant can use to root itself deeply in the earth as it attacks its victim. Despite its fearsome nature, blood maize produces ears of sweet corn larger than those of traditional corn plants. A full-grown blood maize stalk is typically 7 feet tall and, including its root system, weighs about 70 pounds.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  It's said that blood maize plants arose spontaneously in ancient times at the sites of great battles, where blood pooled like rainwater and the plains were covered in broken bodies. In these legends, crops left to wither and rot due to raging wars adapted to their harsh new environs via a mixture of natural hardiness and the latent energies of suffering that permeated the land. The results were the first blood maize. Sustenance would not come to the blood maize, and so the plants developed a way to hunt down their own nourishment, and the blood that once choked their roots instead became their food. Many believe blood maize is evil due to its affinity for blood and the plant's eerie ambulatory nature. However, despite its purported origin story, blood maize is actually unmotivated by anything other than the need for nourishment, albeit via a strange biology born from its dark origins.  While the uninformed often associate blood maize with vampires and other blood-drinking creatures, the plants don't actually drink blood or grapple enemies to drain them. Rather, they instinctually seek to slice the skin of victims; any creatures that bleed are potential prey, though they most commonly stalk humanoids. Blood maize plants slice their prey with their large, sharp leaves, which peel away from their stalks to serve as appendages. These leaves are durable and can stiffen, and the edges are razor sharp. When a blood maize stalk strikes a victim, it roots into place while its leaves lash outward and slice into the victim's flesh.  Blood maize plants absorb spilled blood through their root systems and can do so even while they are mobile. To aid their search for blood, they can uproot themselves to move without impediment, and they can use their roots to dig a firm purchase in the ground. Blood maize can both see and sense movement remarkably well; the plants migrate and search for food at night, and so they are finely attuned to the ground vibrations they use to locate prey.  Although blood maize stalks that haven't fed in days or weeks are tenacious in combat, these plants often try to withdraw from a fight once they've sliced one or more victims to death. When their thirst has been sated, they use their defensive abilities to avoid further violence, though this is more of an instinct for self-preservation than an actual desire to avoid a fight. Foremost among these defensive measures is the blood maize's ability to release a pollen cloud, which allows the plant to retreat from a battle while its enemies are distracted. This cloud is dense enough to block sight for a moment, and though the pollen dissipates quickly, creatures that get it in their eyes discover that it stings painfully. Once its enemies are distracted, a blood maize stalk disguises itself as an innocuous environmental plant in the hope that its enemies will leave the area and not discover the ruse.  Blood maize plants are perennial, and they are reduced to only their root structures during the winter. They regrow their stalks as well as their sweet corn cobs in the spring, and maintain this form throughout the fall. They reproduce only once in their life cycles through a special red kernel produced on one cob, usually in the plant's second year. The other cobs produce normal corn, which is not only safe to eat, but delicious and wholesome. In fact, some hardy frontier homesteaders or settlements prize this corn as a delicacy and mount regular, if perilous, missions to harvest it. Blood maize plants typically live for 4 or 5 years, but there are reports of some in remote locations that reproduce each year and live for a decade or more.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Blood maize plants are found in temperate climates. They are wild plants, but they tend to grow most robustly in rural areas, likely due to the abundance of prey that surrounds them there. Blood maize plants are attracted to gardens and farms, as the stalks can relocate easily in tilled soil and find that birds, livestock, and unsuspecting humans make for relatively easy meal sources. Farmers who don't care to harvest blood maize's corn consider it a dangerous pest, while evil-inclined druids and witch covens sometimes use blood maize to protect gardens and thickets where rare alchemical and  spell components are grown. Of course, these villainous gardeners can't control the plants' bloodlust; if they drop their guard around the stalks, they often find themselves fending off razor-sharp leaves.  Blood maize is rare in the Inner Sea region, but it's more frequently found in Arcadia as well as occasionally on the surviving islands from the shattered continent of Azlant. One account from Vudra describes similarly mobile plant creatures that resemble bamboo but are as bloodthirsty as their blood maize cousins.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Ruins_of_Azlant.jpg","_id":"OXIeSsgDiO5mkZGn"}

The target must succeed at a DC 20 Will saving throw or become transfixed as per <i>lock gaze</i> (Pathfinder <i>RPG Ultimate Combat</i> 236) at caster level 14th. Once a creature has  been affected by this ability, it becomes immune to it for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Glyph Carver (Su)</strong> A thalassic architect can cause its tentacles to vibrate at an intense frequency when it rends through solid matter, such that the tips can engrave inhuman patterns into solid stone. When activated, the tentacles count as adamantine for the purpose of bypassing DR and hardness. Furthermore, the additional sonic damage caused by the tentacles is treated as energy damage when used as part of a melee attack (as per normal) but is treated as additional normal physical damage when used to perform a sunder combat maneuver. The thalassic architect can turn this ability on or off as a free action. While this ability is activated, the tentacles can't be used to manipulate physical objects, nor can the thalassic architect attempt Stealth checks. While this ability is deactivated, the tentacles cause no sonic damage.  </p><p><strong>Mucus Cloud (Ex)</strong> While underwater, a thalassic architect exudes a cloud of transparent slime in a 100-foot-radius spread. All creatures in this area must succeed at a DC 22 Fortitude save each round or lose the ability to breathe air (and gain the ability to breathe water) for 8 hours. If a creature comes into contact with this mucus cloud again and fails another save, the effect extends for another 8 hours. The save DC is Constitution-based.  </p><p><strong>Slime (Ex)</strong> A creature hit by a thalassic architect's tentacle must succeed at a DC 22 Fortitude save or its skin and flesh transform into a clear, slimy membrane over the course of 1d4 rounds. The target's new \"flesh\" is soft and tender, reducing the creature's Constitution score by 4 as long as the effect persists. If the creature's flesh isn't kept moist, it dries out quickly and the victim takes 1d12 points of damage every 10 minutes. <i>Remove disease</i> and similar effects can restore an afflicted creature to normal, but immunity to disease offers no protection from this attack. The save DC is Constitution-based.  </p><p><strong>Water Manipulation (Su)</strong> A thalassic architect is adept at the telekinetic manipulation of matter, including the waters it inhabits. This at-will ability is a standard action with a duration of concentration + 1 round. The ability functions in two different modes that can be used only one at a time.  The architect can force the water around a creature to lock in place and act as a solid, paralyzing the target as per <i>hold monster</i> unless the target succeeds at a DC 20 Reflex save. Aside from using effects such as <i>freedom of movement</i> or <i>remove paralysis</i>, the target can also break free with a DC 20 Strength check. This ability can affect a creature more than once, but each casting grants a new saving throw.</p></div><br /><div><h4><p></p><p>Alternatively, it can thicken water to the consistency of gelatin in a 20-foot radius. Creatures with a swim speed treat this area as difficult terrain. Creatures without a swim speed increase the DC for Swim checks to move through the affected area by 10 (for example, calm underwater areas, usually DC 10, become DC 20). In either case, 5-foot steps become impossible. The save DC is Charisma-based.  \"Thalassic architect\" is a human term for a racial subspecies of aboleth, known as uldraaghus in the language of alghollthus. Uldraaghus were engineered and bred by the mysterious entities that rule the alghollthu race from the deepest oceanic trenches. Whereas aboleths and veiled masters are adept at using telepathy and mental domination, thalassic architects use telekinetic powers to manipulate-even create or destroy-physical matter.  Uldraaghus more closely resemble veiled masters than they do standard aboleths. They're smaller, being about 15 feet long and weighing 2,800 pounds. Furthermore, they have five eyes instead of three; four are set to either side of their head, while a larger fifth eye is set in the center and glows with a brilliant white light. Thalassic architects have four tentacles, two of which end in clawed appendages capable of manipulating objects. Dark bands of scales typically ring their silvery bodies.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Uldraaghus were bred to manipulate physical matter without deviating from the piscine form common to alghollthus. The rulers of the alghollthus realized that their vast intelligence had stripped their race of the ability to perform certain physical tasks without lesser beings to assist them. Not content to become utterly dependent on skum and other subservient creatures, alghollthus bred a new subspecies to fulfill this societal role. Initially, the uldraaghus could move and shape only earth and stone, while they directed the ulat-kini to perform the most tedious labor. Now, given thousands of years of evolution, they've developed the skills to break apart and reassemble matter on a minute level. While other creatures can move dozens of small stones, an uldraaghu can seize control of countless individual water molecules.  An uldraaghu's brain is fundamentally different from that of an alghollthu. It lacks the ability to overwhelm the consciousness of other creatures, though it can still alter their perceptions. Their powers of illusion are seated in the portion of the brain directly behind the central eye, suggesting the center eye is responsible for snaring enemies' attention.  The two tentacles that lack claws are more dangerous than its other limbs. Uldraaghus can vibrate these tentacles at a frequency so high that the tips can carve glyphs in solid stone.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Uldraaghus' place in alghollthu society has shifted over the millennia. Once they were considered little better  than odd mutants by baseline aboleths-useful but crippled. Two factors have altered their station. First, their powers have grown considerably. Second, their alghollthu masters have always kept their population low.  The aboleths have grown accustomed to their alien and cyclopean undersea cities, and skum with mundane implements have limited usefulness without direction. Thus, alghollthus rely on uldraaghus to oversee the creation of new structures. A typical construction crew is led by a thalassic architect assisted by standard aboleths, who direct the workers. When the architecture becomes too complex for skum to build efficiently, the uldraaghu completes the structure itself.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Ruins_of_Azlant.jpg","_id":"RtLmbGC1pCmT0u9m"}

Though the test subjects died during their transformation, the strange energies involved animated them as undead horrors bound to serve their aboleth creator. These abominations share a hive mind, chattering telepathically with each other to determine a common purpose. All of them can be called into action instantly if their aboleth master issues a telepathic command, the dominating words reverberating from one connected mind to another. Abhominals hunger for the life energy of living beings, but their masters can keep their hunger in check in order to make them hunt new subjects to use in further experiments (who might end up sharing the fate of their captors).  The midsection of an abhominal rises to a height of about 2-1/2 feet, though its barbed tentacles go much higher than that. They weigh over 250 pounds.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  An alghollthu that experiments with modifying sentient creatures routinely introduces a part of its awareness into the process so it can exert control over the resulting abominations. The specific transformation that resulted in the first abhominals was particularly grueling and led to many of the subjects dying. However, some subjects survived the initial process, which landed them in a holding cell for further observation. The transformation of the subjects continued within their bodies, and to date the flawed experiment has always culminated in the subjects' death. In their final moments, they are pale and feverish, and their abdomens become bloated. Their nascent telepathy whispers dissonant echoes of the abhominal hive mind reaching out to them. Upon the moment of death, their bodies convulse, limbs snapping at weird angles, and black bile spills from their open mouths. Finally, a mass of tentacles bursts out of the subject's abdomen, and the newborn abhominal screams out a telepathic call to others of its kind.  On the outside, abhominals are reminiscent of the living beings they once were. In addition to their tentacles and twisted postures, their insides have been transformed into something completely alien. When an abhominal is cut, its wounds ooze a brackish black liquid instead of blood. This liquid permeates their entire bodies, coloring their glistening eyes completely black. The creatures have a hardened carapace beneath their skin, allowing them to shrug off deadly blows with ease. Their hands and feet are covered in fine branching bristles that burrow into surfaces, allowing them to scramble effortlessly along even the smoothest walls and ceilings. Their tentacles  are covered in microscopic barbs that inflict profuse bleeding. In addition, abhominals are able to leech vitality out of their victims with their tentacles as they tighten around the unfortunate souls.  Abhominals use their telepathic connection to coordinate their movements when hunting their prey. Abhominals make good sentries-if one of them notices an intruder, then all of its kind within reach are telepathically notified of it as well. When the need arises, their alghollthu master can take a more direct role, commanding its abhominals to utilize more advanced tactics to combat intruders or abduct new captives.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  When the number of abhominals reaches a large enough number, their nesting habits tend to fall into a particular pattern. Abhominals nest high above ground, writhing together in a clump that spreads from the ceiling downward, their tentacles entwining like a web between them. They prefer areas such as caverns or chambers with passages and openings leading to areas below, in which they tend to form a central hive that eventually expands to smaller nests located within telepathic range around it. Once the central hive is established, abhominals use hidden routes to traverse between the hive and its peripheral nests, and smaller groups of the creatures rotate between staying in a nest and prowling the areas around it. Similarly, a rotation of abhominals periodically shifts between the central hive and its outlier nests.  Abhominals are quite dependent on the telepathic connection that binds them together, which results in them going berserk if they are separated from the hive mind. This behavior became evident as soon as the first abhominal came into existence: it raved like a rabid beast, lashing out at anything that came near unless its alghollthu creator exerted psychic influence over it. When the alghollthu's experiments resulted in more abhominals, the abominations started to exhibit more intricate behavior and purpose, and their master found it could direct the newly formed hive mind to serve its own needs. Ultimately, the creatures' usefulness outweighed the annoying reminder of an experiment that continued to fail.  If the abhominals' numbers grow too large, the thoughts of those swarming in the central hive begin to harmonize, exhibiting higher levels of cognizance that could  pose a threat to the alghollthu's control over its creations. It's possible that if the abhominals were left unsupervised, an oversized hive could find a way to turn captives into abhominals on their own, though this is not something their aboleth creators would ever willingly allow. It's important for an aboleth master to regularly reaffirm its dominance over the abhominals under its command to keep the psychic leash that controls them intact.  When under the rule of an aboleth master, abhominals follow that master's directions regarding other creatures. If left without guidance, abhominals are more likely to give in to their hunger and attack all living creatures they encounter; other undead are typically left alone unless they pose a threat to the abhominals. It's possible that certain types of undead could form a mutually beneficial arrangement with a hive of abhominals, consuming the flesh of any humanoid corpses that the abhominals leave during their hunts.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Ruins_of_Azlant.jpg","_id":"SYHU70zTjnR0amPe"}

The chelonidal and allies adjacent to it gain a morale bonus equal to the chelonidal's Constitution bonus on saving throws against effects that would cause them to move from their current square, as well as to their CMD against such effects. When an adjacent ally would be reduced to 0 hit points or fewer, the chelonidal can use its lay on hands ability to help that ally as an immediate action; the chelonidal is then staggered for 1 round.  </p><p><strong>Celestial Soldier (Sp)</strong> A chelonidal's natural weapons, as well as any manufactured weapons it wields, are under the constant effects of <i>greater magic fang</i> or <i>greater magic weapon</i> (as appropriate). The caster level of these effects is equal to the chelonidal's Hit Dice, including Hit Dice gained from class levels or other effects.  </p><p><strong>Lay on Hands (Su)</strong> A chelonidal can use lay on hands as per a 9th-level paladin. This ability cures fatigue and exhaustion in addition to damage, as though the chelonidal had the appropriate mercies.  </p><p><strong>None Shall Pass (Ex)</strong> When making attacks of opportunity provoked by movement, a chelonidal adds its Charisma bonus to the attack roll. On a hit, the target immediately stops moving in its current square and can't move until the start of its next turn.  </p><p><strong>Protective Shell (Su)</strong> A chelonidal's fortified shell protects it from many threats. A chelonidal can't be flanked, and attacks that would benefit from flanking deal only half their normal damage to the chelonidal. In addition, the chelonidal's touch AC is modified by its natural armor bonus. As a standard action, a chelonidal can create total cover along one edge of its space, as though using a tower shield; this total cover applies to others as well as the chelonidal.  </p><p><strong>Underwater Mobility (Ex)</strong> While completely submerged in water, a chelonidal gains the benefits of Dodge, Mobility, and Spring Attack.</p></div><br /><div><h4><p></p><p>Chelonidal agathions are the foot soldiers and guards of Nirvana. While the realm's inhabitants prize enlightenment over militarism, the agathions recognize that vigilant guardians are necessary to the preservation of peace. Chelonidals form from the souls of those who willingly gave their lives in defense of a person or place, or who protected the sea from terrestrial threats.  Like all agathions, chelonidals are capable of speaking with any linguistically gifted creature. Their voices generally have a gravelly quality that reminds most listeners of a grizzled veteran soldier. This idea is reinforced by the chelonidals' habitual good-natured cantankerousness, as well as their fondness for war stories.  Chelonidals and dwarves often get along well, despite the latter race's dislike for the sea; the agathions share dwarves' resolve, as well as their traditional military tactics. Trudd, dwarven deity of strength and defense, has arrangements with several legions of chelonidals, and he occasionally sends them in response to <i>planar ally</i> spells.  A typical chelonidal is 6 feet tall and weighs 400 pounds.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  A chelonidal's body is well suited to its role. While its hands resemble a sea turtle's flippers more than they do the hands of terrestrial humanoids, it has no difficulty performing tasks that require manual dexterity. A chelonidal's turtle-like head grants it a powerful bite  attack, while its bright eyes can pierce invisibility with ease. Potent magic permeates its shell, diffusing magical attacks and firearm strikes and protecting it from treacherous backstabbing. Additionally, in times of need, a chelonidal can turn its back to its enemies, using its shell as an impenetrable shield that halts all attacks.  Like other outsiders, chelonidals have no need to eat or sleep. A chelonidal can maintain its post with unceasing vigilance for years or even centuries, if need be. Chelonidals don't normally reproduce sexually, being directly formed from the petitioners of Nirvana. However, given their tendency to protect locations for long periods, those on the Material Plane occasionally fall in love with mortals. If such a relationship results in children, the chelonidal parent remains until its offspring come of age, departing only if a great need arises; the lords of Nirvana understand that the duty to protect must be counterbalanced with duty to family. Such children are usually idyllkin aasimar (<i>Pathfinder Campaign Setting</i>: <i>Inner Sea Races</i> 238) rather than more powerful half-celestials.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Chelonidals guard the peaceable plane of Nirvana. Whether guarding the celestial realm's sites or marching in formation along its roads, chelonidals stand ever vigilant to repel assault. As their appearance suggests, they are also at home in the water; while their normal phalanx tactics are of less use in three-dimensional underwater combat, they make up for it with additional mobility in aquatic environs.  On Nirvana, most chelonidals serve more potent agathions without complaint. The empyreal lords Dalenydra and Ylimancha, in particular, often associate with chelonidals. Every so often a chelonidal feels the urge to wander; while it never leaves a post without securing a replacement, once one is found, the agathion wanders for a time before settling down again. Some find their way to the Material Plane during this period. Without a specific task, a chelonidal on the Material Plane often finds a secluded but vulnerable location, such as a remote fishing village or shrine, and defends it until protectors can be found or trained.  While chelonidals defend those who cannot defend themselves, they are at their strongest when they stand alongside those with the strength and will to fight. A single chelonidal can bolster a mortal legion, keeping the troops fighting until reinforcements arrive. In greater numbers, chelonidals form a phalanx, trusting in allies to clean up any foe that makes it past their guard. On those rare occasions when the agathions must march to war, chelonidals form the core of their armies. Led by cervinal knights and supported by soaring avorals, a chelonidal legion is a force potent enough to make any fiendish combatants think twice.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Ruins_of_Azlant.jpg","_id":"XfeuG8B1FYxPcxYH"}

Affected clockwork creatures, including the clockwork overseer, gain a +1 competence bonus on saving throws, attack rolls, and weapon damage rolls; these bonuses are already calculated into the clockwork overseer's statistics. As a standard action, a clockwork overseer can intensify the aura until the beginning of its next turn, increasing the competence bonus to +2.  </p><p><strong>Lash (Ex)</strong> A clockwork overseer's lash is a primary natural attack that deals bludgeoning damage.  </p><p><strong>Overclock (Ex)</strong> In place of making a lash attack on its turn, a clockwork overseer can overclock another clockwork creature within its reach, impelling it to exceed its performance limitations. At the beginning of its turn, an overclocked creature takes an amount of damage equal to half its Hit Dice (minimum 1), expends 1 full day of activity stored by its winding ability, and gains one of the following benefits, selected by the clockwork overseer  • The overclocked creature gains the benefits of <i>haste</i>.  • The overclocked creature's natural attacks and attacks with metal melee weapons deal an additional 1d6 points of fire damage. If the creature already deals fire damage, including with a breath weapon or the swallow whole ability, that special attack's fire damage increases by 2d6.  • The overclocked creature gains Combat Reflexes as a bonus feat and gains a +2 bonus on attack rolls when making attacks of opportunity.  A clockwork overseer can end this effect on a clockwork creature affected by its aura of command as a free action. The overclocked condition otherwise continues until the clockwork creature expends its stored days of activity or is destroyed.  </p><p><strong>Tactical Calculus (Ex)</strong> A clockwork overseer can store hundreds of commands and scripts, allowing it to perform modest feats of problem-solving and strategic command as though it had an Intelligence score of 10. In practice, this enables a clockwork overseer to make tactical decisions, such as exploiting terrain or flanking targets, as well as convey simple tactical commands to other clockwork creatures in its aura of command. If the clockwork overseer takes electricity damage, it must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = the electricity damage dealt) or lose both its aura of command and tactical calculus abilities for 1d4 rounds.</p></div><br /><div><h4><p></p><p>What clockwork creatures boast in both strength and resilience, they often lack in nuance and strategy. Most machinists are content to command their constructs directly when seeking tactical precision, but only a few artificers have the technical expertise needed to create a mechanical lieutenant capable of reasoning and adapting in its master's absence. Known as clockwork overseers, these constructs boast extraordinarily complex programming that far exceeds the basic command vocabulary of other clockwork creatures. This allows clockwork overseers to store hundreds or even thousands of commands, which they can parse and sort quickly enough to simulate an intelligent creature's adaptive thinking-at least regarding combat strategy and moderately complex tasks of coordinating construct laborers. These functions fall short of true thought, and clockwork overseers are incapable of language, emotion, higher thinking, or symbolic reasoning beyond specific sounds and statements they might parrot on command.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Like most clockwork creatures, clockwork overseers are finely tuned creations of metal, gears, and magic, but they differ in two major regards: their mechanical \"brains\" and their kinetic generators. The complex inner workings of a clockwork overseer's programming  core are an order of magnitude more complicated that those of its counterparts, composed of delicate arrays of counters, springs, toggles, and other perfectly fitted components that collectively store and compute data.  Clockwork overseers can compel even greater feats from their subordinates, though doing so requires direct contact between the constructs via the overseer's lash to convey an electrical charge. This electricity builds over time, accumulated by static energy discharges created by the movement of limbs and gears. Most clockwork creatures respond readily to this electrical goading, overriding their standard operating specifications based on the exact combination of current and voltage the overseer conveys. Clockwork overseers harness and exploit electricity in small amounts, but they're as vulnerable as other clockwork creatures to massive discharges-arguably more so, since such attacks can scramble an overseer's decision-making hardware and temporarily reduce it to a truly mindless state.  Numerous cultures and machine schools have built clockwork overseers over the ages, emphasizing different martial techniques in the process. These variant clockwork overseers can grant a different combat feat-typically one for which they qualify-to their minions. What's more, these overseers sometimes represent the last record of otherwise extinct fighting styles; a creature with the Craft Construct feat or that succeeds at a DC 21 Craft (clockwork) or Knowledge (engineering) check can spend 8 hours deciphering an overseer's mechanical \"brain\" in order to decode the stored combat feat, using this new knowledge as the basis to learn the feat or teach it to others.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Since they are artificial constructs, clockwork overseers almost always exist because either a skilled artificer or a machinist created them. The creator typically already owns several other clockwork creatures and needs a capable, tireless entity to direct them. As a result, a clockwork overseer  is only rarely encountered alone, unless attrition, misfortune, or time have destroyed its entourage.  Under rare circumstances-especially involving areas of sustained magical energy-an overseer can independently learn new tricks or even develop self-awareness. These creatures often commandeer other clockwork creatures, creating tiny fiefdoms dedicated to building new wonders or helping the overseer attain true sentience. The faithful of Brigh seek out such awakened constructs, considering it their duty to protect and guide these mechanical \"children.\"  <br /><strong>Construction</strong><br />  The creator of a clockwork overseer must start with crafted clockwork pieces worth 2,000 gp.  <br /></p><section id="ClockworkOverseer"><div class=\"heading\"><p class=\"alignleft\">Clockwork Overseer</p><div style=\"clear:both\"></div>  <strong>CL</strong> 12th; <strong>Price</strong> 42,000 gp  <br /><hr /><strong>Construction</strong><hr />  <strong>Requirements</strong> Craft Construct, <i>geas/quest</i> and <i>haste</i>, creator must be at least caster level 12th; <strong>Skill</strong> Craft (clockwork) DC 20; <strong>Cost</strong> 22,000 gp<p></p></div></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Ruins_of_Azlant.jpg","_id":"Zl5bgkwmFdOqHgJd"}

The tidewretch can never stray more than 300 yards from this piece of driftwood. A tidewretch who moves more than 300 yards beyond her bonded driftwood immediately becomes staggered and takes a -2 penalty on her attack and damage rolls and ability and skill checks and to the save DCs of her special abilities (including spell-like abilities). Every hour thereafter, she must succeed at a DC 15 Will save or these penalties increase by 2 (increases are cumulative). A tidewretch that is out of range of her bonded driftwood for 24 hours gains 1 negative level, which becomes permanent 24 hours thereafter, at which time she gains another negative level. Eventually, this  separation destroys the tidewretch. Unlike a dryad, a tidewretch can't forge a new bond with another piece of driftwood, though many tidewretches find that they can carry their driftwood with them, as it is not rooted to the ground like a living tree.  </p><p><strong>Parasites (Ex)</strong> The first time each round a tidewretch hits a target with a melee attack, a swarm of small parasites issues forth from the rotting wood that makes up her body, covering the target and causing discomfort and distraction. The target becomes staggered, but it can spend a standard action to brush the parasites off its body and end the effect.  </p><p><strong>Vermin Empathy (Ex)</strong> This ability functions as a druid's wild empathy, except a tidewretch can use this ability only on vermin. A tidewretch gains a +4 racial bonus on this check. Vermin empathy treats swarms as one creature having a single mind; a tidewretch can thus use this ability to influence and direct swarms with relative ease.</p></div><br /><div><h4><p></p><p>Tidewretches are undead dryads whose trees have died and become waterlogged driftwood. The dead state of the tree to which a tidewretch is bound is reflected in her disfigured appearance, especially her wrinkled and cracked wooden skin. Bits and pieces of the tidewretch have completely rotted away, leaving nothing but scar-like holes in her decomposing flesh. A tidewretch's fingers have sharpened into claws, and her eyes have become cold and dark. Tidewretches are home to hosts of parasites, and small insects can be seen skittering in and out of their cracked skin. When alone, tidewretches regularly weep tears of dirty water in lament for their fallen trees.  Tidewretches are usually around 5 feet tall and weigh about 90 pounds.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  When a dryad's tree dies and falls into a body of water, the dryad inhabiting it sometimes survives to become a twisted, vengeful tidewretch. Such a creature follows the largest section of the remains of her dead tree down the currents of whatever body of water it travels, having little control over where it might end up. Along the way, the undead fey slowly begins to rot, quickly collecting parasites and fungi that survive on the nutrients in the driftwood and in the tidewretch herself.  Tidewretches are viewed as unnatural by regular dryads and other fey. Animals are easily spooked by their presence, and water-dwelling creatures give them a wide berth. However, a tidewretch's quick movement through lakes and rivers makes her difficult to keep track of and predict. Tidewretches stalk riverbanks and shorelines for unsuspecting creatures to torment and destroy before moving on. They leave their victims in a particularly grotesque state: their victims' bodies are drained of all natural fluids, which are replaced to the point of overflowing with filthy, brackish water.  Despite their love of killing, tidewretches have no need to eat flesh to survive, and they continue their undead existence as long as their bonded driftwood remains intact. Because their survival depends on the security of their driftwood, many tidewretches hide their bonded driftwood among large piles of detritus or bind their driftwood with chains or sturdy seaweed ropes to the bottom of a body of water, floating like haunted buoys deep beneath the surface. Occasionally, a tidewretch may drag her driftwood inland and carve it into a piece of furniture, an idol, or a totem, or she might even use it as part of the construction of a makeshift structure. In any case, the tidewretch works to ensure her driftwood is either hidden or obscured so that her greatest weakness does not bring about her undoing.  A tidewretch is considered a menace to nature, and she is a highly sought-after target for druids and protector fey. Tidewretches take trophies from hunters who fail to destroy them, as reminders of both the warmth of life and their undying desire to survive no matter the cost. This leads to them collecting treasures that they store in the crevasses of their driftwood trees. These large stashes of treasure often lead more hunters and adventurers to seek the riches that ancient tidewretches carry.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Tidewretches' constantly traveling, mobile homes make for many potential habitats. Usually, a tidewretch is either moving with a current or settled on a still body of water. Tidewretches most often originate along the sides of forest rivers, and as such they encounter plenty of living victims as they travel along those rivers to their eventual resting places. While tidewretches who keep moving with the water tend to survive longer than those who remain in one spot-becoming the subjects of legend as their victims pile up-many of them try to stay in the same place for long periods of time if they can guide themselves to still water. Stationary tidewretches prefer to live in environments that resemble those where their trees used to grow. Such tidewretches seek to emulate living dryads, even burying their tree's roots and draping any branch-fragments with greenery.  Tidewretches are solitary creatures by both nature and circumstance. They arise rarely and can end up in many different locales. They do not get along with creatures other than the vermin that occupy their trees and bodies, and they permit the company of others of their kind only out of a shared sense of survival. Most groupings of tidewretches (called tangles) last only briefly, collapsing when their respective members turn on one another and  try to destroy each others' driftwood to ensure dominance, or else parting ways quickly to avoid such a fate.  There are rare circumstances in which pairs of tidewretches settle in the same still water for extended periods of time. Usually the two choose to join forces to hunt and continue their tortured existences together. Such tidewretch \"sisters\" maintain a tenuous balance of power, and they are most often equals, sharing a single ambition rather than scrabbling to claim authority.

The smoke sentinel merely has to move over its opponents, and it affects as many creatures as it can cover. It cannot make other attacks during a round in which it engulfs a creature. A targeted creature can make an attack of opportunity against the smoke sentinel, but if it does so, it is not entitled to a saving throw against the engulf attack. A creature that does not make an attack of opportunity can attempt a DC 21 Reflex saving throw to avoid being engulfed; on a success, it is pushed back or aside (target's choice) as the smoke sentinel moves forward. An engulfed creature takes 1d6 points of Wisdom damage at the start of its turn each round it remains within the smoke sentinel's space. The save DC is Dexterity-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.  </p><p><strong>Gaseous (Ex)</strong> A smoke sentinel can pass through small holes  and even cracks without reducing its speed. It cannot enter water or other liquids. It has no Strength score and cannot manipulate objects. Its gaseous form renders the smoke sentinel immune to all nonmagical attack forms. Even when hit by spells or magic weapons, it takes only half damage. Spells and effects that do not deal damage have only a 50% chance of affecting a smoke sentinel. A smoke sentinel has no natural armor bonus, but it has a deflection bonus equal to its Charisma bonus.  </p><p><strong>Tethered (Su)</strong> A smoke sentinel is tethered to a hollow physical object (usually a small box or totem) from which it can travel no farther than 1 mile. An intelligent creature who holds the construct's tether for at least 1 hour gains the ability to control the smoke sentinel as though it were the target of a <i>dominate monster</i> spell. This control lasts until another intelligent creature holds the tether for an hour or more, whereupon that creature gains control of the construct. If its controller dies or otherwise ceases to command the smoke sentinel, the construct continues carrying out its most recent command. Should its last command be a finite task, the smoke sentinel reverts to the role of guardian when finished, keeping potential threats away from the site of its tether. A smoke sentinel can compress to fit within its tether as a full-round action. While in the tether, it recovers from damage at a rate of 1 hit point per hour.</p></div><br /><div><h4><p></p><p>Smoke sentinels are clouds of sentient black smoke that protect isolated ruins throughout the shattered continent of Azlant. As amorphous clouds, smoke sentinels have no distinguishing features, but they often extend their bodies into long tendrils that slither along the ground like hungry vines. No matter how thin a smoke sentinel may make its form, its smoke remains thick and opaque, hiding everything within it from view. Though the strange electrical energy that courses through its body crackles and arcs, the resulting illumination provides no insight into what may lie at the cloud's heart.  A smoke sentinel usually attempts to determine an intruder's intentions through use of its <i>see alignment</i> and <i>detect thoughts</i> spell-like abilities. It may take the form of a trusted associate or loved one in order to further interact with the trespasser and bring deeper thoughts and motivations to the creature's surface thoughts. Unless directly threatened or certain that the target of its investigation poses a threat to its master or other sworn charge, the smoke sentinel employs illusions and <i>fear</i> to confuse and frighten the interloper away. Only in extreme cases or when instructed to do so does the construct use its deadly physical attacks.  While it can compress and condense its form to fit into incredibly small spaces, a smoke sentinel most often appears as a weightless cloud occupying approximately 3,500 cubic feet of space.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Smoke sentinels were created through magical means to serve as resolute sentries of their creators' homes, protecting inhabitants and their livelihoods from attackers and raiders. Smoke sentinels do not need to eat, sleep, or breathe, and they can compress to fit into extremely small spaces due to their gaseous nature.  Smoke sentinels do not age, though as they grow accustomed to their land and as they see creatures and people they were meant to protect slowly die off, they are prone to becoming overprotective. Each smoke sentinel is created along with an Azlanti artifact that anchors it to a specific spot. If it moves more than a mile from this tether, it loses control of its physical form, and if kept beyond this range for too long, it might disperse completely. As such, smoke sentinels are careful about the range of their patrols.  Despite their gaseous nature, smoke sentinels are capable of coalescing the smoke that makes up their bodies into clawlike tendrils to protect themselves. A smoke sentinel often reveals its presence with whirring, almost mechanical noises that permeate the air as it approaches.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Smoke sentinels are most often depicted in ancient Azlanti texts as benign creatures that warded off invaders and helped their culture flourish in times of great struggle. While many in the modern day consider smoke sentinels to be extremely dangerous, the creatures do not murder without cause. If someone takes a relic from its creator, desecrates a corpse, or steps onto ground its programming denotes as hallowed, a smoke sentinel seeks only to right that wrong.  At the peak of the Azlanti civilization, smoke sentinels took the forms of Azlanti warriors and patrolled the borders of towns and cities to ward off invaders. They were considered great protectors, and they were occasionally used in Azlanti armies as a way to induce terror in enemy ranks.  There are few examples of rogue smoke sentinels in history, but in late Azlant just prior to Earthfall, some priests with delusions of grandeur or revenge fresh on their minds created smoke sentinels not as protectors, but as tools for assassination and sabotage. However, once such a smoke sentinel completed its mission-and it would  inevitably complete its mission-the construct would return to its tether not to regenerate but to destroy the artifact in a form of construct suicide. This raised an ethical concern among the Azlanti: Are smoke sentinels truly just constructs, built only to serve a singular purpose? Or do they have consciousness, a soul? This ethical dilemma eventually led to the practice of using smoke sentinels falling out of favor, and even being banned completely in some regions. As a result, by the time Azlant sank into the sea, very few smoke sentinels remained, and fewer still survive to this day.  <br /><strong>Construction</strong><br />  While many secrets of Azlanti technology have been recovered from the depths of time, expert golemcrafters have yet to reverse engineer the means of building a smoke sentinel and tether. Current theories postulate that unique <i>ioun stones</i> must be utilized in the creation process, though what shape or color these <i>ioun stones</i> need to take remains a mystery.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Ruins_of_Azlant.jpg","_id":"csitW75wDPBlPmk5"}

At the beginning of every turn the creature remains enshrouded, it takes 6d6 points of acid damage and 1 point of Charisma damage as the mimic ooze absorbs it. The mimic ooze uses the AC and saving throw bonuses of the enshrouded creature for attacks and effects that deal hit point damage, but the enshrouded creature can choose to not avoid an attack or an effect. Damage dealt to the mimic ooze is divided between it and the creature it's enshrouding, and vice versa. While the mimic ooze is enshrouding a creature, it can't take any actions other than to release the creature as a move action. If a <i>freedom of movement</i> spell is cast on the enshrouded creature, the  creature is no longer enshrouded and the mimic ooze falls off and reforms in an adjacent unoccupied space.  </p><p><strong>Floating (Ex)</strong> A mimic ooze can tread on liquid as if it were firm ground.  </p><p><strong>Hypnotic Flow (Su)</strong> The body of a mimic ooze can move and flow in a peculiar mixture of familiar and alien motions. A creature within 30 feet of it becomes fascinated for 1d4 rounds (Will DC 18 negates). Once a creature succeeds at a save against the fascination effect, it remains immune to this ability for 1 hour. The save DC is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Pool (Ex)</strong> A mimic ooze can release its humanoid form, emulating a pool of dark liquid. An observer must succeed at a DC 25 Perception check to notice the unnatural flow of the pool. If the mimic ooze initiates combat from this state, it gains a +6 bonus on its initiative check.</p></div><br /><div><h4><p></p><p>Mimic oozes consist of deep-black liquid that has taken on a humanoid form. The liquid dissolves organic matter rapidly, which can pose a serious threat to any creatures that come into contact with it.  Not only can these mimic oozes learn the behavior of other creatures, but they can even imitate it as well. If a mimic ooze comes into contact with a creature physically, it envelops and consumes that victim, leaving behind nothing but a clean skeleton and any durable gear that the creature was carrying. As a mimic ooze absorbs a victim, it takes on some echoes of its mannerisms and thoughts as well as the target's outward features, which contribute to the ooze's primitive, chaotic mind. These jumbled shadows of thought fall second to the impulse that mimic oozes have to devour sentient humanoids.  Mimic oozes either stalk creatures they notice nearby, waiting for a chance to close the distance between them, or lie in wait for their prey to come near. Once a mimic ooze has enshrouded a creature, it doesn't release its victim unless forced to do so. It's rumored that more advanced mimic oozes have been able to form more coherent minds, though these are still alien in their function and purpose.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Ruins_of_Azlant.jpg","_id":"dTMpZN7IsO9vopA9"}

The save DC is Constitution-based.</p></div><br /><div><h4><p></p><p>Long before the aboleths uplifted humanity, these deep-sea-dwelling entities experimented on other aquatic life forms, perfecting the art of genetic manipulation and developing entities that would become their unyielding servants. The creatures known as chuuls today (a derivation of their alghollthu name, \"chu'ulothis\") were little more than aggressive crustaceans prior to aboleth meddling. Only after successive generations of guided evolution were chuuls transformed into the hulking monstrosities they are today, and their keen intelligence likewise came from their aboleth masters' uplifting.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  The larval form of a chuul most closely resembles an oversized lobster. A typical chuul nest usually contains 6-8 rocklike eggs, though only half of the larvae survive hatching, as these vicious creatures' first meals are the weakest of their clutch mates. Upon hatching, a larval chuul lacks the paralytic tendrils and claws of its mature form, but instead has the capability to spray digestive fluid in a wide cone. Larval chuuls predigest their meals and are engineered to crave the cerebral tissue of intelligent creatures.  Only through feeding on the brains of intelligent creatures do chuuls develop their own intelligence and linguistic abilities. A chuul unable to feast on cerebral tissue of a creature with an Intelligence score of 8 or higher within the first year of hatching never becomes a mature chuul, though it continues to grow in size. Larval chuuls can be represented by larval chuuls with the advanced creature and giant creature simple templates. The more intelligent members of  their species loathe these creatures and destroy them whenever they are discovered.  After a yearlong maturation process that requires the larval chuul to digest up to five brains of Medium or larger creatures, the larva undergoes a slow molting process over the course of a month. During this time, the larval chuul grows to Medium size and loses its bite attack. When the chuul sheds its larval carapace, it gains two claw attacks and the paralytic tendrils of its mature form. A lesser chuul's tendrils are fully grown at this stage, though they appear enormous on the lesser chuul's smaller body and allow for surprisingly long reach. A lesser chuul's paralytic secretions are not as strong as the adult form's, but retain some of the acidic qualities of the larval chuul instead. These tendrils are used for capturing and eating prey and for easy access to cerebral tissue (typically acquired by forcing a tendril into an eye socket or nasal cavity). A lesser chuul's appetite for cerebral tissue is largely vestigial at this point in development, and tapers off entirely by the time it reaches maturity.  Two years after its hatching, a lesser chuul enters a second month-long molting stage from which it emerges as a fully grown adult chuul. Due to the relatively slow development cycle of larva to adult (with regard to aboleths' patience), these creatures are often bred in enormous numbers to mitigate any loss of adult chuuls that may be suffered during the service of their deep masters. Rumors persist of deep, calm coves on remote islands that host hundreds of chuul young. If such legends are true, no one has ever survived making such a discovery to report the exact location of their find.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Within aboleth society, chuuls are seen as a slave race and, despite their intelligence, are rarely regarded as more than cattle. The ulat-kini (also known as skum) are the alghollthus' preferred servitor race, and chuuls within aboleth society are brutally conditioned to accept their prescribed inferiority. Outside of aboleth society, chuuls are largely independent and curious creatures with an innate cruelty bred into their species by their aboleth creators. Even larval chuuls have this inherent sense of malice, further developed through inflicting suffering on other sentient creatures.  Rare chuuls that have existed for generations outside of aboleth society may be of chaotic neutral alignment  rather than chaotic evil, though these creatures still require the cerebral tissue of intelligent creatures to develop their own sentience, making a chuul clutch's ultimate shift away from inherently evil tendencies unlikely. Aboleth-serving chuuls typically destroy these independent groups as soon as they are discovered, though some find refuge in the deepest and darkest corners of the oceans of Golarion where not even aboleths tread. These chuuls make alliances with deep merfolk and other inhabitants of the lightless reaches of the deepest oceans.  <strong><strong></strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>Variants</strong></strong></p><p></p><p>  While the majority of all chuuls are represented by the statistics presented in the <i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</i>, some unique variants were created or modified by aboleth masters to serve specific roles in far-reaching plans, or have evolved different physiologies in response to vastly different environments.  <br /><strong>Arctic Chuuls:</strong> Arctic chuuls were designed to inhabit the freezing waters of the Crown of the World. These cold-dwelling creatures have cold resistance 10 and a burrow speed of 20 feet usable only in snow or ice.  <br /><strong>Deep Chuuls:</strong> A deep chuul is dusky gray to midnight blue in coloration and bears a glowing antenna that sheds light like a torch, much like an anglerfish's lure. Deep chuuls can use this light to fascinate creatures as per the <i>hypnotism</i> spell (CL = the chuul's Hit Dice).  <br /><strong>Psychic Chuuls:</strong> Chuuls that feed on the brains of creatures capable of casting psychic magic (see <i>Pathfinder RPG Occult</i> Adventures) sometimes develop inherent psychic magic abilities of their own in the form of spell-like abilities, but they are destroyed on sight by aboleths who encounter them. Rumors persist that psychic chuuls are capable of evolving into a new state beyond that of the adult chuul form.  <br /><strong>Sand Chuuls:</strong> Rarest of all chuul breeds, sand chuuls inhabit parched wastelands and deserts, and were intended to serve as the shock troops of a land invasion force following Earthfall. When the aboleths' plans failed to come to fruition, these specially engineered chuuls were largely forgotten. Now native to blasted regions of Casmaron and southern Garund, sand chuuls lack the aquatic subtype, the amphibious special quality, and a swim speed. Instead, a sand chuul has a burrow speed of 30 feet and tremorsense out to a distance of 30 feet.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Ruins_of_Azlant.jpg","_id":"emVjaByxaSY7aSsA"}

This damage type lasts until the ooze no longer has that type of damage reduction. The adaptive ooze can also reproduce an energy  type it comes into contact with. The ooze's slam attack deals an additional 2d6 points of energy damage of a single energy type randomly chosen from the types of energy it is currently immune to due to its adaptive resistance ability.  </p><p><strong>Adaptive Resistance (Su)</strong> An adaptive ooze can rapidly develop resistances to its most pressing threats. When the adaptive ooze takes bludgeoning, slashing, or piercing damage, it gains DR 10/adamantine against that damage type starting at the beginning of its next turn. This DR lasts for 1 hour. Additionally, when an adaptive ooze takes hit point damage from a particular type of energy (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic), it gains immunity to that energy type starting at the beginning of its next turn. The adaptive ooze can maintain immunity to only three energy types at once, losing the oldest immunity it has when it takes hit point damage of a fourth energy type. This immunity lasts for 1 hour or until it is replaced with a new immunity.</p></div><br /><div><h4><p></p><p>Adaptive oozes are composed of an amorphous substance that flows like liquid metal, but they can harden this form to a consistency resembling tempered steel. When adaptive oozes attack, they form pseudopods that strike out at targets and take on characteristics of weapons the oozes have recently been struck by. They can also assimilate different energies into their forms, becoming immune to them and even reproducing them for a limited time. Adaptive oozes can break down both organic and inorganic substances and incorporate those materials into their bodies to grow their mass. They are especially drawn to organic creatures that have more complex compositions. However, their digestive process is very slow, so they need to disable creatures that might fight back or attempt to flee. Adaptive oozes go through a cycle of accumulating mass until they split into two in order to propagate, after which the cycle begins anew. Adaptive oozes that have just split begin life with the young creature simple template. Adaptive oozes that are in resource-rich areas can accumulate mass very rapidly, gaining the giant creature simple template before they reach the end of their reproductive cycle. These huge adaptive oozes can split into more than two parts when they divide.  Adaptive oozes can achieve a height of 8 feet, taking on an almost spherical form when stationary, and weigh about 2,200 pounds.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Ruins_of_Azlant.jpg","_id":"fXVdxyukM9r6kyKS"}

The island must be no larger than 1 square mile in area per Hit Die the nisid has (usually 6 HD), and the nisid must be the only intelligent creature on the island for 1 uninterrupted year to cement the bond. After the bond has been formed, the nisid gains the isolation and never come back abilities (see below), and receives a +4 racial bonus on Survival checks while on his island. A nisid who leaves his island for more than 1 hour per Hit Die or whose island  is inhabited by an intelligent creature for longer than 1 month per Hit Die loses its island bond and must restart the bonding process, either on a new island or on the same island once all prerequisite conditions are met.  </p><p><strong>Isolation (Su)</strong> A trespasser on the nisid's bonded island must succeed at a DC 17 Will save every full day she remains on the island or she takes 1d2 points of Wisdom damage as the nisid magnifies the trials of survival on an uninhabited and dangerous island with little hope of rescue. This Wisdom damage does not heal naturally until the trespasser leaves the nisid's island (though it can be healed through magic normally), slowly driving her mad. The nisid can suppress this ability at will; typically, it does so until it determines the trespasser will not soon leave of her own volition or is otherwise going to be trouble. This is a mind-affecting curse effect. The saving throw DC is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Never Come Back (Su)</strong> The nisid's ties to its island help keep it hidden from repeat visits, ensuring that even trespassers who want to return find doing so difficult. When a trespasser leaves a nisid's bonded island, she must attempt a DC 17 Will saving throw. Failure results in her memories of the place becoming hazy-especially when it comes to locating it again. She takes a -10 penalty on Survival and Knowledge (geography) checks to determine the island's location or find it again, and the island and the nisid are treated as though under the effects of a permanent <i>nondetection</i> spell for any divination spells the target casts (use the nisid's caster level to determine the difficulty of overcoming this effect). This is a mind-affecting curse effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p></div><br /><div><h4><p></p><p>Nisids are castaway spirits, protectors of uninhabited or deserted islands. These little fey look like they might once have maintained a more delicate and youthful appearance, but after having spent decades or centuries alone, they look haggard, with unkempt hair and tough skin. Nisids rarely wear clothing, as they have little need for modesty or protection. They are excellent survivalists, living off what their island can provide.  Loners by nature, a nisid claims and forms a bond with a single uninhabited island as his territory, and he seeks to preserve the island's untouched sanctity-and his own solitude. Should someone happen upon a nisid's island, whether as a castaway, stranded by a storm, or deliberately seeking something, the nisid first spies on the interloper using <i>invisibility</i> and <i>detect thoughts</i> to assess her intent. If he determines that the trespasser simply wishes to get off the island, the nisid often offers to help his guest survive and escape (if only to hasten the process and return the island to its isolation). Using magic and his natural skill at survival, he may give the castaway access to water, food, or shelter-in exchange for leaving the island unsullied when she leaves. Those who agree and please the nisid  might even be gifted with a final <i>gust of wind</i> to send them on their way.  However, those who arrive with no intention of leaving hastily, or who drastically overstay their welcome without hope of escape, find the nisid a more hostile host, as a nisid finds murder a small price to pay for solitude. Unwelcome guests find the trials of survival and hopelessness to be maddening, and every day drift closer to insanity through the nisid's isolation ability. Once the trespassers have been driven toward madness, the nisid attempts to turn them against each other, sowing distrust and casting <i>confusion</i> on large groups. If all else fails, the nisid might coax charmed animals, the nisid's only companions, into attacking interlopers: nothing says \"get off my island\" like a giant beast crashing out of the jungle.  With no desire to die-only to be left alone-the nisid eschews direct combat as much as possible, preferring to have his enemies deal with each other or succumb to the dangers of the island itself. If pushed to combat, he casts <i>call lightning</i> and attempts to strike down his enemies from hiding, using his knowledge of the island to his advantage.  Even when helping agreeable castaways, the nisid won't make life too easy, lest the trespassers decide to extend their stay. He makes just enough food and water available to sustain the \"guests,\" using abilities like <i>hallucinatory terrain</i> to keep any particularly bountiful areas of the island hidden. Should the island be a truly deserted one, perhaps where an ancient civilization once flourished, a nisid is especially vigilant in keeping ruins or artifacts that could attract further interest in the island well hidden. And once a castaway leaves a nisid's island, she rarely finds a way to return.  A typical nisid stands 4 feet tall and weighs 70 pounds.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Not much is known of nisids, since they are rarely encountered and even more rarely remembered. The first nisids may have been castaways themselves, banished from the First World until they discovered the small islands on which they could be alone, or other fey spirits who found their little pieces of land suddenly cut off from everything else. Whatever their origin, most nisids have lived solitary lives for decades or centuries-and prefer it that way, finding solace in solitude and having no desire to share their hidden homes.  Nisids can be any gender, but have little interest in companionship or reproduction. With no one around to impress, they don't care about their appearance-though their fey nature still shines through despite their neglect. Over time surviving alone, their hair becomes ragged and their skin grows exceptionally tough. They craft their few weapons out of whatever the island has to offer.  Nisids have no interest in treasure, as they have no use for it; however, they tend to collect the belongings of those who wash up on their shores and don't escape. They keep their treasure troves well hidden to prevent attracting interest from other trespassers.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Nisids might choose any small, uninhabited island as home, regardless of climate. Jungle isles filled with strange fauna are equally as appealing to them as barren rocks in the icy north or island ruins in temperate climes.  Some nisids favor deserted islands that once held civilization of some kind as homes. Those who choose such locales have the additional goal of keeping their islands' ruins a secret from outsiders; the last thing a nisid wants is a boat full of explorers and adventurers arriving on his island to plumb its depths, and he will use his abilities to keep such adventurers away.  Nisids are introverts to the extreme. They have no interest in any kind of company, and engage in conversation for only as long as it takes to accomplish their goals. There is never more than one nisid on an island. No one has learned why nisids prefer such isolation, or what they do in their long years alone. Perhaps they spend time meditating on their leave of the First World-or seek a way back.  A nisid's only companions are the local fauna, which the nisid charms to act as guardians. Small islands far from continental land are known for their oversized animals, and a canny nisid in residence holds the threat of such beasts as motivation for trespassers to leave or to avoid the island's inner depths-perhaps unleashing the animals upon them should their stay provoke hostility. However, their relationships with dolphins are a bit antagonistic, as the creatures delight in attempts to force the nisid to socialize and guide travelers to their isolated islands.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Ruins_of_Azlant.jpg","_id":"iHOVYHOYhKfyzhMX"}

Once the item is embedded, its magic is channeled into the paguroida's body and the item no longer functions normally. It is not considered to be wielded or worn, and the item functions as though in an <i>antimagic field</i> while embedded in the paguroida's shell. A paguroida that has embedded magic  items with a total caster level that is at least equal to its Hit Dice (11 for a typical paguroida) gains a +4 deflection bonus to its AC and a +2 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls. A paguroida with embedded magic items whose total caster level is at least twice the creature's Hit Dice doubles these bonuses and gains the advanced creature simple template (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</i> 294). A paguroida can remove an embedded magic item as a full-round action, adjusting the total caster level of its embedded items accordingly. The magic item can then be wielded or worn, but it still functions as if in an <i>antimagic field</i> for 1d4 minutes, after which time it returns to normal function.  </p><p><strong>Nondetection Aura (Su)</strong> A paguroida emits an aura out to a radius of 30 feet that makes divination difficult. All creatures and objects within the aura are affected by a <i>nondetection</i> spell that requires a successful DC 20 caster level check to overcome. Creatures or objects revealed to a spellcaster who succeeds at this caster level check remain detectable for 24 hours to that spellcaster, even if the creature or item exits and reenters the aura. A paguroida automatically succeeds at the caster level check to overcome this effect when using its constant <i>detect magic</i> spell-like ability.  </p><p><strong>Psychic Magic (Su)</strong> A paguroida begins each day with a number of PE equal to twice the total caster level of all magic items embedded in its shell. (The statistics above assume that the paguroida has items with a total caster level equal to 11 embedded in its shell.) Removing or adding a magic item after the start of the day does not increase or reduce this number until the next time the paguroida regains PE.  </p><p><strong>Undersized Weapons (Ex)</strong> Although a paguroida is Large, its upper torso is the same size as that of a Medium humanoid. As a result, it wields weapons as if it were one size category smaller than its actual size (Medium for most paguroidas). Additionally, because it has only one hand-its other appendage is tipped with a massive pincer-a paguroida can wield only a shield or a light or one-handed weapon at a given time.</p></div><br /><div><h4><p></p><p>Believed to have been created by the aboleths in ages long past as part of the alghollthus' experiments on the murajau (<i>Pathfinder Campaign Setting</i>: <i>Planes of Power</i> 59), paguroidas are reclusive, hermit crab-like monstrous humanoids who live in hidden grottoes and seaside estuaries, typically on isolated or remote coastlines. One of their upper limbs terminates in a humanoid hand, while the other ends in a large pincer capable of gripping and crushing prey. A paguroida's face is similar to that of a crab, with protruding eyestalks and a wide mandible-filled mouth, though its torso is distinctly humanoid in shape and size. A typical paguroida stands 7 feet tall and weighs 1,200 pounds.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Paguroidas live solitary but long lives-their isolation and extreme paranoia about interaction with other species  precludes many unnatural causes of death. In most cases, a paguroida eventually succumbs to old age after having lived for as many as a dozen centuries. Despite their longevity, paguroidas are not fecund, and they reproduce only once every 200-300 years after reaching reproductive maturity at the age of 150. Female paguroidas each lay a single egg in a secluded location, which they abandon among a small cache of magical items from their shells. Nearby male paguroidas locate the eggs by following the unique magical aura they exude, as well as the magical auras of the items in the eggs' cache-nests. Once fertilized, an egg ceases to emit such an aura, but the male that fertilized it remains nearby to protect it during the 6 months it gestates before hatching.  Hatchlings are incredibly vulnerable, their shells taking as many as 5 years to harden. Paguroida fathers often give their offspring one or more magical items from their own shells, and they assist the offspring in embedding them and the items from their mothers' cache-nests into their soft shells to bolster their defenses in their first year.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Paguroidas live almost entirely alone, only rarely congregating in groups, generally for purposes of defense or to consolidate resources. Even then, these groups almost never exceed 10 members, as paguroidas have an innate understanding that the valuable items embedded in their shells would draw more treasure hunters to them, negating the advantages of greater numbers.  Typically making their lairs near ancient ruins filled with long-abandoned magical relics, paguroidas prefer to dwell in underwater grottoes inaccessible from the surface. They protect these lairs with powerful illusions and abjurations, counting on remaining hidden to protect themselves and their treasures from potential thieves. A paguroida who encounters an intelligent interloper first attempts to trick the creature into leaving its territory, preferring to avoid conflict altogether. If discovered and unable to persuade the trespasser to leave, a paguroida may offer one of the magic items from its shell as a bribe to send the unwanted guest on its way. This is often a last resort, however, as most paguroidas know that once  granted a single item of power, most creatures will seek more and respond with force if their demands are denied.  Because of their mutual penchant for hoarding wealth, dragons are a paguroida's primary threat, and the crabfolk avoid even good and neutral dragons out of a strong sense of self-preservation. Only when offered substantial magical wealth as signs of good faith do paguroidas cooperate with dragons, and even then they do so warily.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Ruins_of_Azlant.jpg","_id":"mfDDk17FXtxbGxLq"}

Each socketed stone grants the golem full access to the stone's abilities and benefits, as though it were orbiting the <i>ioun</i> golem. An <i>ioun</i> golem gains 10 temporary hit points for each <i>ioun</i> stone socketed in this manner, to a maximum of 60 temporary hit points if all slots are filled. Temporary hit points last for 24 hours and each socket can grant temporary hit points only once per day, regardless of how many <i>ioun</i> stones are placed within it during that period. A socketed <i>ioun</i> stone cannot be independently targeted, but it can still be the subject of a successful stealAPG or sunder combat maneuver performed against the <i>ioun</i> golem. Socketing or removing an <i>ioun</i> stone is a move action.  </p><p><strong>Immunity to Magic (Ex)</strong> An <i>ioun</i> golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted below.  ? A <i>shatter</i> spell deals damage to an <i>ioun</i> golem as though it were a crystalline creature (no saving throw) and has a 25% chance of dislodging a random socketed <i>ioun</i> stone, causing the gem to fall into an adjacent square.  ? A <i>telekinesis</i> spell can be used to attempt a disarm combat maneuver check to remove a socketed <i>ioun</i> stone. The <i>ioun</i> golem takes a -10 penalty to its CMD against such an attempt.  ? A <i>mage's disjunction</i> spell causes all socketed <i>ioun</i> stones to turn dull gray and become useless for the next hour (no saving throw).  </p><p><strong>Ioun Attraction (Su)</strong> The innate connection an <i>ioun</i> golem has with <i>ioun</i> stones manifests in a specialized aura of magnetic force. <i>Ioun stones</i> orbiting a creature that are brought within 60 feet of an <i>ioun</i> golem are immediately targeted by a stealAPG combat maneuver using the <i>ioun</i> golem's CMB. Targets of this combat maneuver receive a +4 circumstance bonus to their CMD against this steal attempt. Any stones successfully stolen in this manner are pulled toward the <i>ioun</i> golem and can be immediately socketed into an available receptacle as a free action. If no free receptacles are available, the pilfered <i>ioun</i> stones orbit the <i>ioun</i> golem, granting the golem their powers as normal. Unattended or protected stones, such as those embedded in the skin or held inside a <i>wayfinder</i>, are unaffected by this aura. An <i>ioun</i> golem can suppress and reactivate this aura as a swift action.  </p><p><strong>Ioun Surge (Su)</strong> Once per round as a swift action, an <i>ioun</i> golem can channel the energy of one of its socketed <i>ioun</i> stones, as long as that stone is not dull gray. This manifests as <i>magic missile</i> (caster level 16th), except it conjures five missiles, each dealing 2d6+1 points of force damage. When the <i>ioun</i> golem uses this ability, the selected socketed <i>ioun</i> stone becomes dull gray for the next 1d4+1 rounds.</p></div><br /><div><h4><p></p><p>The Azlanti empire employed numerous different types of golems in its defense and also as members of a growing mechanized workforce. These golems eventually found themselves supplanted by increasingly popular clockworks in the waning centuries of the empire. Still, one model of golem remained as a constant reminder of Azlanti supremacy: the <i>ioun</i> golem. Designed to the unique specifications of the Azlanti intelligence agency, the Ioun Imperative, these golems were a visible sign of Azlant's ability to harness magic as a replacement for conventional technology.  Immense quantities of alchemically purified brass, platinum, and silver are required for the construction of an <i>ioun</i> golem. Silver forms much of the base frame, while platinum is poured into areas intended as gem receptacles. Brass filigree overlays the body, conducting the magical energy necessary to animate the golem. Occasional lines of vibrant magical energy are visible along the golem's brass sections when viewed with effects such as <i>analyze dweomer</i>, <i>detect magic</i>, or similar effects.  A typical <i>ioun</i> golem stands 12 feet tall and weighs close to 1,200 pounds.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Ioun golems are the pinnacle of Azlant's research into the esoteric science known as electro-thaumaturgy. This mysterious art allowed for the transmission and broadcast of pure arcane energy. The golem's body is crafted to store magical energy and can even siphon further energy from other battery-like magical devices- specifically, the iconic Azlanti <i>ioun</i> stone. An <i>ioun</i> golem's frame has enough energy to keep itself animate for centuries without rest, but the addition of an <i>ioun</i> stone, even for a moment, extends the active cycle of an <i>ioun</i> golem into millennia. By quickly siphoning the innate power of a socketed <i>ioun</i> stone, the golem can unleash the stored energy as a blast of magical force.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  The cataclysm that consumed Azlant also destroyed most of the Empire's <i>ioun</i> golems. Those that survived are now scattered across the shattered continent, either long inactive without access to their <i>ioun</i> stone batteries or ceaselessly fulfilling their last orders. Across the eons since the fall of Azlant, only three <i>ioun</i> golems are officially recorded to have made their way to Avistan-washed ashore after untold millennia of inactivity. The Red Mantis are said to keep one as a defender within the Crimson Citadel on Mediogalti Island. Another remains dormant and unpowered in a museum in the heart of Oppara. The final <i>ioun</i> golem is cited in numerous archives as appearing briefly across the continent, fulfilling some as of yet unknown agenda.  A handful of <i>ioun</i> golems operate across Golarion in secret, actively serving their surviving overseers. These golems no longer follow their original Azlanti masters but instead serve the powers truly responsible for their creation: the veiled masters. Seen as a status symbol among alghollthus, an <i>ioun</i> golem guardian demonstrates either the commanding veiled master's cunning in acquiring the construct or the veiled master's age and determination to survive.  <br /><strong>Construction</strong><br />  The art of crafting an <i>ioun</i> golem is almost entirely lost to time. What few manuals remain on the subject of constructing an <i>ioun</i> golem may be found only in the most secure of Azlanti ruins, if any survive at all. Should adventurers discover some long-forgotten instruction manual, they learn that an <i>ioun</i> golem is built from 2,000 pounds of the finest brass, silver, and platinum, costing an extravagant 70,000 gp in raw materials alone. Six unique <i>ioun</i> stones must be  provided during the construction, though these stones are not consumed in the attempt.  <br /></p><section id="IounGolem"><div class=\"heading\"><p class=\"alignleft\">Ioun Golem</p><div style=\"clear:both\"></div>  <strong>CL</strong> 18th; <strong>Price</strong> 220,000 gp  <br /><hr /><strong>Construction</strong><hr />  <strong>Requirements</strong> Craft Construct, Craft Wondrous Item, <i>geas/ quest</i>, <i>wish</i>, creator must be at least caster level 18th; <strong>Skill</strong> Craft (armor) DC 24, Craft (jewelry) DC 29; <strong>Cost</strong> 145,000 gp<p></p></div></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Ruins_of_Azlant.jpg","_id":"oid7XmqWE5XjQL5V"}

This can change the outcome of the roll. The affected creature must be within 60 feet of the portunus.  </p><p><strong>Bonded Harbor (Ex)</strong> When on the Material Plane, a portunus attunes itself to a natural bay, fjord, or inlet. While in its bonded harbor, a portunus is considered to  be on its home plane and does not gain the extraplanar subtype. A portunus loses its fast healing when not on the Plane of Water or within its bonded harbor.  </p><p><strong>Boon (Su)</strong> Though a portunus cannot grant spells, it can grant a minor boon to those who properly propitiate it. To receive the boon, a character must perform a 1-minute ritual in or adjacent to the portunus's bonded harbor and succeed at a DC 21 Knowledge (nature) check. The ritual fails if the portunus is not in its harbor or if it has an attitude of unfriendly or hostile to the supplicant. If the ritual is a success, the character can call upon this boon once within the next 24 hours to roll twice on a skill check and take the better result. A character cannot benefit from more than one boon at a time and cannot attempt this check more than once per day. Granting a boon requires no action by the portunus, and there is no limit on the number of boons it can grant.  </p><p><strong>Capsize (Ex)</strong> A portunus can attempt to capsize a boat or ship by ramming it as a charge attack and attempting a combat maneuver check. The DC of this check is 25 or equal to the result of the boat captain's Profession (sailor) check, whichever is higher. For each size category the ship is larger than the portunus, the portunus takes a cumulative -10 penalty on this combat maneuver check. The portunus can spend points of mythic power (as part of this action) to reduce the penalty by 10 for each point of mythic power spent.  </p><p><strong>Liquid Form (Sp)</strong> As a standard action, a portunus can turn into a mobile pool of water. This functions as <i>gaseous form</i>, except the portunus can't fly in this form, but it can enter water. It retains its base speed, and its swim speed doubles to 120 feet. The portunus can end this ability as a standard action.  </p><p><strong>Transparency (Su)</strong> A portunus's body is transparent, rendering it effectively invisible when underwater. It can become visible or transparent at will as a free action.</p></div><br /><div><h4><p></p><p>Portunuses are a kind of water elemental who inhabit natural harbors. They embody both the regular rising and falling of the tides and the inconstant shifting of the weather. Humanoids who live along bays inhabited by portunuses often revere them as <i>genii loci</i>, and they may give prayers and offerings to the elementals in hopes that their ship will come in-whether literally or figuratively. A portunus is naturally invisible underwater, but when it chooses to be seen, it resembles a translucent, statuesque humanoid with four arms and two faces. The portunus's faces can be the same or different genders. They move about the elemental's head independently, sometimes facing in opposite directions and at other times cheek to cheek. The portunus can sense and speak from either or both faces, though it has a single mind.  When standing, a portunus towers nearly 24 feet tall and weighs around 12,000 pounds.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Portunuses are rarely seen, even by those who live along the harbors where they dwell. A portunus shows its approval by granting its boon and by using its spell-like abilities to provide unseen aid. If humanoids don't give the proper respect to its harbor, a portunus shows its displeasure with subtle acts of sabotage, such as causing small leaks in ships or <i>rusting</i> away anchor chains. Only if these hints are ignored does the portunus resort to more destructive magic. A portunus revealing its true form is a sign that momentous events are occurring. The portunus may do so to punish a spellcaster who offends the gods or to defend its harbor-and its pious residents-from a disaster or invasion. Rarely, a portunus may reveal itself to a fellow servant of nature or fate in order to provide information or assistance.  Portunuses are pious creatures who revere deities of the sea and weather and deities of luck and fate. Indeed, many portunuses consider themselves agents of these gods, even if they are not part of any formal structure. Portunuses of the Inner Sea region point to Gozreh's two faces or Pharasma's affinity for the element of water as proof of their divine connections. Portunuses consider it their duty to keep watch over those who employ magic to alter tides, winds, or luck to ensure they use their powers judiciously and with humility. A spellcaster who abuses or becomes reliant on such magic risks being attacked by a portunus for his hubris. Particularly strong magic may even draw portunuses from their harbors to investigate.  Portunuses do not actively seek out treasure, but over the years, they may accumulate a hoard from the offerings tossed into their harbor by supplicants and the lost cargo of ships that sink nearby. Even so, those who attempt to salvage a portunus's treasure find their efforts stymied by the unseen elemental. Yet, a portunus is sometimes willing to give some of its treasure to those in need. Such recipients may never know who their benefactor is, as these gifts appear to be merely washed up on the beach.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  On their native plane, portunuses are most often found where the Plane of Water borders other planes, playing among the storms where it meets the Plane of Air or hiding within the chasms where it meets the Plane of Earth. Large chunks of other elements floating in the endless sea might also contain hollows where portunuses dwell. On the Material Plane, each portunus is bound to a specific natural harbor, which serves as a link to its home plane. A portunus can leave its bonded harbor, but these excursions are infrequent and usually short.  Though they might be found along any coast, portunuses are most common in regions with many inlets, especially the sunken continent of Azlant, the many islands of Iblydos, and the fjords of the Lands of the Linnorm Kings.  Portunuses serve as protectors of their harbors and the creatures that live there. While they may be initially wary of humanoids making use of their harbors, most portunuses come to view them as just another part of the bay's ecosystem, as long as the humanoids are respectful of nature.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Ruins_of_Azlant.jpg","_id":"pzTa1Gqb3FRb82st"}

The oni selects a grid intersection within 30 feet on or beneath the surface of a body of water as the center of the eddy. The oni can attempt an immediate grapple combat maneuver check against any enemies within a 10-foot radius of this point, as though the targets were within its reach. As a swift action in each subsequent round the eddy remains in place, the oni can maintain the grapple on those targets caught within the eddy's grasp (attempting a separate combat maneuver check for each target). In order to pin a target or deal damage with this effect, the oni must take a standard action as normal. The eddy persists as long as the kigyo continues to take  at least a swift action on its turn to maintain a grapple. The effect immediately ends if all targets escape the eddy or if the kigyo does not spend any actions to use this ability, falls unconscious or dies, or moves more than 30 feet from the eddy's center. The kigyo can maintain only one grasping eddy at a time.  </p><p><strong>Trident Mastery (Ex)</strong> Kigyos are experts at employing tridents as deadly weapons. The oni gains Weapon Focus (trident) as a bonus feat and treats a trident as having a range increment of 20 feet when underwater, even though throwing weapons underwater is normally ineffective for most combatants.  </p><p><strong>Underwater Grappler (Ex)</strong> Kigyos are skilled grapplers and know how to use their underwater environs to their advantage when in close combat with their foes. A kigyo gains a +4 racial bonus on grapple combat maneuver checks while it or its target is at least partially underwater. This bonus also applies to grapple combat maneuver checks the kigyo attempts while using its grasping eddy ability. The kigyo gains no bonus to its CMD against grapple attempts.</p></div><br /><div><h4><p></p><p>Oni are most often found in Tian Xia on the opposite side of the world from ancient Azlant, though some, such as the powerful ogre mage, have expanded their influence to include other continents including Avistan and Garund. Not all oni live on land, however, and the vengeful spirits have been known to take the form of humanoid species that dwell mostly or entirely underwater. While most oni are rare, those that take aquatic forms are scarcely ever encountered by terrestrial folk, though locathahs, merfolk, and other aquatic races are more likely to encounter these sea-dwelling oni than they are to meet ogre mages or other land-borne spirits. The most common submarine oni is the kigyo, which adopts a form resembling a corrupted parody of a merfolk.  Like merfolk, kigyos have a torso and arms, with an aquatic lower body that allows them to maneuver lithely through the water. Unlike a merfolk, however, a kigyo has a monstrous face and its body more closely resembles that of a seahorse.  A typical kigyo is 7 feet long from its head to the tip of its curved tail and weighs 190 pounds.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  As with many types of oni, kigyos are hateful, vengeful creatures that prey upon mortals not out of necessity but out of spite and malice. Kigyos enjoy seeing their victims drown, and they are said to be drawn to the sites of shipwrecks or tragic deaths at sea where mortals met their end in the unforgiving ocean. While this may not be true, plenty of kigyos have been the cause of such deaths, either in combat or by manipulating their  victims into dangerous situations from which they could not escape. Kigyos have the ability to create powerful underwater currents that swirl in tight eddies, latching on to multiple creatures and holding them in place until they either drown or fall victim to the oni's other attacks.  In the same way that a kigyo draws a sense of accomplishment from drowning a victim, it also feels a sense of superiority at making an enemy willingly give up something of incredible value in exchange for its life or that of a loved one. To oni, life and mortality are foreign concepts, and they can derive only so much pleasure out of seeing a living creature's essence snuffed out by death. As jealous and possessive beings, however, kigyos can more easily comprehend the sacrifice of giving up something other than one's life. Many kigyos develop obsessions with a single type of ransom they demand, such as firstborn children, spouses, a victim's reproductive or sensory organs or lungs, or even (in rare cases) pure material wealth. Those who hunt kigyos or research kigyo activity across the world can sometimes follow a single oni from nation to nation and from ocean to ocean by the specifics of what it demands of its victims. Thus have specific kigyos developed almost mythic status while victims across both distance and time suffer the same sadistic fate at the oni's hands.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Kigyos rarely congregate with others of their kind, preferring instead solitary lives in the forms of aquatic elves, gillman, locathahs, merfolk, or other aquatic or shore-dwelling humanoids. In these forms, kigyos attempt to seduce unsuspecting mortals, and trick them into bringing the oni-who usually pretend to be castaways or injured victims-onto their vessels or into their seaside communities. Once in these societies, kigyos bed unsuspecting mortals who take pity on them and then abscond with items of value while their partners are sleeping. After amassing particularly valuable or numerous prizes, a kigyo reveals itself to its victims and demands a ransom of something far more precious for the items' return.  Like all oni, kigyos are filled with hatred, especially for their uncorrupted kami counterparts. Kigyos see suijins in particular (<i>Pathfinder Adventure Path #52</i>: <i>Forest of Spirits</i> 88) as contemptible, and they are known to form elaborate hunting parties to seek out the benevolent nature spirits and destroy them and the untainted waters they protect. These raiding bands constitute the few large groups of kigyos on Golarion, and they can present deadly threats to those who  encounter them, be they kami or other creatures. The oni fight tactically in tandem, half of the kigyos using their grasping eddy abilities to hold their foes in place while the other half surround and stab at them with their tridents. Even when encountered alone, a kigyo presents a formidable challenge to even the most adept underwater fighters, as it can hold an entire party in one of its powerful whirlpools, reducing its foes' ability to conduct their own group fighting tactics.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Ruins_of_Azlant.jpg","_id":"t1URnk4Ang3og4EM"}

An entranced creature can take no action other than to move at its normal speed into a space within the crimson musk willow's reach, at which point an entranced creature remains motionless and allows the willow to insert tendrils into its brain.

Each creature within its aura suffering from a detrimental or unwanted transmutation effect can attempt a new saving throw against the effect. This power also works on any afflicted lycanthrope, entothrope, or similar creature, granting it a new saving throw to remove its affliction. At the GM's discretion, burst of restoration can have a special effect on creatures permanently mutated by magic, such as fleshwarps or Mana Waste mutants (<i>Pathfinder Campaign Setting</i>: <i>Inner Sea Bestiary</i> 28). A creature undergoing this greater effect loses its unwanted acquired templates or reverts back to its original form, but it must succeed at a DC 25 Fortitude saving throw or take 2 permanent negative levels as a result of the sudden and dramatic change to its physiology. The save DC is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Clarity's Grace (Su)</strong> A prydanu's aura protects those around it from mind control and all forms of deception, both magical and mundane. All allies within her aura gain a +4 sacred bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting spells and abilities and on Sense Motive skill checks. A prydanu's aura negates illusions. This functions as <i>globe of invulnerability</i>, except it can affect only spells or spell-like abilities from the illusion school and can affect spells of any spell level.  </p><p><strong>Lucid Rain (Su)</strong> Once per week as a full-round action, a prydanu can create an area of light rain centered on her with a radius of 120 feet that lasts for 10 minutes. Any creature touched by the rain that is under the effects of a mind-affecting spell or effect can attempt a new saving throw to end those effects. Prydanus often use this ability during naturally occurring rainstorms on villages or cities they feel may be in trouble.</p></div><br /><div><h4><p></p><p>Prydanus are fierce champions of Elysium who use their talents to undo the work of oppressors by revealing their deception and releasing their victims from bondage. Among the prydanus' most hated foes on Golarion are the alghollthus. Prydanus are drawn to civilizations under the thrall of tyrants. Prydanus do not tolerate such deceptions, and they combat them without hesitation whenever they encounter them. However, this lack of restraint sometimes makes for shortsighted plans of action leading to other consequences along the way.  Prydanus pride themselves on being guardian figures, and they delight in helping distressed individuals, especially those attempting to escape from any form of subjugation. Given their natural tendency toward vanity, prydanus appreciate (and perhaps even expect) being showered with praise for their good deeds, and those who sufficiently stoke a prydanu's ego may find a returning ally in that azata when future troubles arise.  Radiant and poised, a prydanu appears as an attractive humanoid with small patches of iridescent scales on its glistening skin. A graceful pair of translucent finlike wings extends from its back, not only allowing it to soar with ease but also granting it impressive agility underwater. Their striking silver eyes are framed with long, feathery lashes and match their metallic-colored nails and lips. A prydanu's hair varies from one individual to another but is usually several shades and decorated with jewels, flowers, shells, or other such adornments.  A typical prydanu stands 8 feet tall and weighs 400 pounds.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Creatures of Elysium, prydanus arise from the souls of brave liberators and defenders of justice. Though they enjoy spending time on their native plane, they often to venture onto the Material Plane, where they scour the lands for oppression.  Prydanus are well adapted to the water and often make temporary dwellings near oceans and lakes. When it comes to underwater prowess, their sleek musculature and powerful wings place them on par with naturally aquatic creatures. This aptitude is a point of pride for prydanus, who enjoy racing marine life to prove their expertise.  The anatomy of prydanus resembles that of humanoids, and while they cannot reproduce, they engage in intimate acts with one another or mortal lovers. Similarly, they don't need to eat or drink, but they partake of these pleasures in the spirit of camaraderie.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Prydanus enjoy the company of their kin, finding particular companionship in ghaeles and yamahs. Prydanus are athletic creatures, and their fondness for swimming and flying is well documented; presenting it a gift of artwork depicting seascapes or a collection of feathers and shells is a way to get on its good side. They are also quite sentimental and keep small trinkets from places and people they've helped, often displaying these tokens in the form of small charms worn on bracelets or necklaces or woven into their colorful locks.  After using their powers to free creatures from domination and forced transformation, prydanus often continue to care for them even after their liberation to ensure they're safe before continuing on their way. Though these sojourns are fleeting even by mortal standards, prydanus easily become emotionally attached to the creatures they save, and saying farewell is difficult for them. As such,  most prydanus leave their companions' sides in the middle of the night, when most are sleeping, to make the parting easier.  When not battling against tyranny, prydanus enjoy studying emancipated societies to view the daily life of mortals left to make their own choices. They chronicle these thoughts and observations in journals, which they then share with other celestials in Elysium.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Ruins_of_Azlant.jpg","_id":"war74hLmghNFDFJm"}

Those who live near blood lilies know to be wary of the plants, but as nonanimate blood lilies also grow in such areas, it can be difficult to tell the dangerous plants from the inert ones. To complicate matters, blood lilies have learned to hide their scarlet petals when hunting. A favorite trick of these plants is to disguise themselves next to ordinary blood lilies, using their harmless kin as a distraction. When travelers pass by, the predatory blood lilies then attack from concealment.  Blood lilies commonly grow in tropical areas near coastlines, where they hunt both in and out of the water. Fish and other aquatic creatures are drawn to the blood lily's brilliant petals, sometimes mistaking them for colorful tropical fish. Blood lilies can slaughter and consume dozens of small fish in under a minute if a school draws close enough. Though blood lilies devour such prey whole, the masticating action of the edges of a blood lily's digestive orifice leaves clouds of blood in the water. Their blossoms also attract giant insects, which can be dangerous and damaging to the plant creatures. Blood lilies can easily defend against most of these vermin, but they almost never eat insects, preferring warm-blooded prey above all others.  Blood lilies have an animalistic cunning and can use surprisingly sophisticated tactics for plants. Blood lilies that grow near the settlements of intelligent creatures (such as humans on land or merfolk underwater) keep their petals hidden and hide among other plants to better ambush their prey. When they grow in remote areas far from any settlements, they keep their petals exposed to draw in animals. Blood lilies remember the location of fertile hunting grounds and adapt their tactics based on the prey they seek. Surprisingly mobile, they sometimes travel long distances to hunt and feed at these fertile locations. A few naturalists have recorded rare blood lilies that never remain in the same area for long, roaming far and wide until they mature enough to enter a transformative hibernation (see page 85).  A blood lily is composed of a thick trunk plated with extremely tough but flexible green bark. An orifice lined with large thorns splits the trunk about halfway up its length. The blood lily uses this opening to devour its prey. Potent acids inside the creature's trunk dissolve fleshy organic matter quickly, allowing the lily to eat much more than would seem possible given its size.  A lily's vines are covered in the same hard bark as its trunk, and the vines are lined with tiny thorns that seep poison. The blood lily gets its name not only from their vivid coloring but also from the disturbing effects of their toxin. Creatures affected by a blood lily's poison bleed from their pores, coating their skin in a light sheen of crimson. The blood lily focuses its attacks on bleeding victims, assuming they have been weakened by its toxin. However, a blood lily cannot distinguish between a creature bleeding from the blood lily's poison and one bleeding from a wound. Individuals traveling in areas where blood lilies are common sometimes carry bladders of animal blood to splash nearby during combat, confusing any blood lilies as they attack.  Though most blood lilies live and hunt alone, they occasionally come together to form small pods. In particularly rich hunting grounds where the lilies don't have to compete for prey, they work together in pods to bring down victims. Pods are adept at felling large creatures or groups of smaller creatures by working in tandem. Though a pod's tactics are simple, it can take on even dangerous creatures. The blood lilies in a pod spread out and conceal their petals until their target is in range, and then they all unleash their petal barrages at once. The nearest lily then moves to attack with its vine lash while the other lilies continue to fire petal spikes until they deplete their reserves. All lilies then move in to finish off their victim with vine lashes.  Blood lilies reproduce asexually. Once a lily matures, it begins to grow a small bulb-like structure called a bulbil near the base of its stem, protected by its foliage. The bulbil takes 12 to 18 months to mature, at which point it drops off the parent plant and grows into a mature blood lily within a year. If released on land, a bulbil takes root in the soil, from which it draws sustenance; if released underwater, it drifts with the currents, drawing sustenance from the water as it grows. Blood lilies don't protect their released bulbils; many are consumed by predators, and in areas where hunting is poor, adult blood lilies might even consume their own immature sprouts. If a sprout reaches maturity, it gains the ability to move under its own power and begins to hunt.  Mature blood lilies can live for decades if hunting remains good and they aren't killed by other predators. A blood lily that survives for at least 10 years sometimes enters a hibernation phase during which its petals fall off and its vines wrap around its trunk, forming a cocoon-like structure.  After a season of dormancy, the blood lily sprouts larger, darker petals that carry the same toxin as the thorns in its vines. The blood lily's vines undergo a growth spurt, gaining an extra 5 feet in length. These blood lilies are hardier than their lesser kin and can challenge even the deadliest predators. They have the advanced creature simple template, they add their poison to attacks with their petal spikes, and their reach with slam attacks increases by 5 feet.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Ruins_of_Azlant.jpg","_id":"z0M3DQHxlsRlnopp"}

Although effects such as <i>remove</i> blindness/deafness can <i>remove</i> the blinded or deafened condition from a creature paralyzed by a litanu, this does not <i>remove</i> the paralysis. This ability is a necromancy and paralysis effect.</p></div><br /><div><h4><p></p><p>Litanus are undead abominations created by vile necromantic rituals and psychological torment. All litanus were once merfolk, but were tortured to death and animated as undead creatures. Litanus are sneaky, spiteful creatures who seek prey suffering from loneliness and fear.  Resembling merfolk that have hyperdeveloped musculature, litanus have wide mouths with narrow, sharklike teeth. Four tentacles sprout from a litanu's back, each a few inches wide and 4 feet long. These tentacles end in toothy maws and excrete a paralyzing toxin so powerful that victims are rendered insensible and unable to perform most autonomic functions, including breathing, until the toxin wears off.  A litanu is about 7 feet long from head to tail and weighs around 300 pounds.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Because litanus are created from merfolk subjected to horrifying tortures and necromantic infusions, they generally arise in underwater torture chambers or corpse pits. Although they have no need to hunt for sustenance, they derive a perverse joy from ambushing, paralyzing, and killing prey. Most litanus prefer to hunt intelligent prey, as complex feelings of isolation and desperation resonate with the undead creatures. Angry at their fate and resentful that their kin were spared it, litanus prefer merfolk as prey over all others. A hunting litanu might even allow non-merfolk to pass by unharmed if it believes that a little more patience might allow it an opportunity for merfolk prey instead.  Litanus are immensely strong for their size, and their long, toothed tentacles are exceedingly nimble. These tentacles are grafted to a litanu's body in the final part of the reanimation ritual, rather than spontaneously grown. Litanus are protective of their tentacles, taking care to keep them clean and prevent them from becoming tangled together as the undead swim or fight.  Despite their strength, litanus are reluctant to attack humanoids that are traveling in packs, preferring to use traps or trickery to scatter groups so they can attack the isolated individuals one by one. If given time to prepare, a litanu might set a harmless trap that triggers a large spray of mud, sand, or another material that temporarily obscures visibility in the water. When the trap is triggered and the members of the group are disoriented and blinded, the litanu sneaks forward, paralyzes the nearest target, and swims away while its victim is incapacitated. To draw a single target away from a group or community, a litanu might stake down a small sea creature into the seabed and wound it sufficiently so that it cries out in pain. The litanu hides nearby, ready to ambush an individual that comes to aid the suffering creature. Not all litanu tricks are so complex; some litanus simply lurk  ut of sight and make quiet rhythmic tapping sounds to draw the more curious members of a group to investigate, slipping away if too many come to investigate together.  Although any isolated creature suffering from fear or loneliness is a delicacy for a litanu, most litanus attempt to exacerbate feelings of dread and isolation as much as possible before feeding. A litanu might drag a victim into the deep, dark ocean waters-not so deep as to kill their prey outright from cold or water pressure, but deep enough to amplify the victim's fear and suffering. When the victim's feelings of terror and isolation are at their peak, the litanu finally kills its prey with slow, deliberate bites from its tentacles.  Once a litanu slays its victim, it usually loses interest in the corpse. The litanu might steal any valuables or trinkets from the body but otherwise leaves it to drift away on the ocean currents. A litanu does not value this plunder for its own sake, but it collects items, such as shiny necklaces or colorful baubles, that might be useful in luring away future victims.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Litanus live underwater and prefer the seclusion of dark ocean waters. Unaffected by cold or water pressure, they can be found in deep ocean trenches. From there, they range into brighter, shallower waters to hunt for prey. If a litanu's prey escapes onto land, the litanu is unlikely to pursue; although litanus can propel themselves on land by using their tails and tentacles if necessary, they prefer to remain in the water.  To merfolk, litanus are terrifying bogeymen that lurk in the deep, set traps to catch the unwary, and drag their victims away. Fortunately, litanus are rare, so most merfolk have never seen one; some merfolk believe that they don't even exist, and were invented to explain away strange disappearances or half-glimpsed natural predators such as octopuses. Those merfolk who have met a litanu (or worse, have been terrorized by a litanu that arose from the corpse of a friend or relative) know firsthand the fear and carnage even a single litanu can create.  Litanus are sufficiently rare as to normally be solitary; a litanu might hunt for decades without meeting another of its kind. On the rare occasions when litanus do find each other-or when they are created alongside each other- they gather into small gangs called schools. Litanus are selfish by nature, so this tendency to congregate is unusual and perhaps due to some dimly instinctual sociability from their merfolk heritage. Even so, litanus don't work well together. They might initially discuss building complicated traps or agree to divide up spoils in an equitable  fashion, but each litanu considers itself more worthy than the others. They therefore subtly sabotage each other's traps, secretly steal one another's victims, and even interfere with attacks, purely out of malice. Litanu schools inevitably come to blows after a few weeks or even days, leaving only the strongest litanu as a survivor.

It can pass through small holes, narrow openings, and even mere cracks, but it cannot enter water or other liquid. It has no Strength score and cannot manipulate objects as a result.  </p><p><strong>Hypoxic Heart (Ex)</strong> A living doldrums can engulf foes, as per the universal monster ability. A creature engulfed by a living doldrums doesn't gain the pinned condition and can move normally, but it is still in danger of suffocating.  A creature that begins its turn engulfed takes 6d6 points of damage and must succeed at a DC 23 Fortitude saving throw or be slowed (as per the spell slow). This condition lasts as long as the creature is in the living doldrums' space and for 1d4+1 rounds after it leaves. Creatures that don't breathe take no damage from the living doldrums' engulf attack and do not risk being slowed. The living doldrums extinguishes all nonmagical fires in its space. The save DC is Constitution-based.  </p><p><strong>Hypoxic Touch (Ex)</strong> A living doldrums' touch attack hinders a creature's ability to breathe. A creature that takes damage from this attack must succeed at a DC 23 Fortitude saving throw or be slowed (as per the spell slow) for 1 round. Creatures that don't breathe are immune to this attack. The save DC is Constitution-based.  </p><p><strong>Natural Invisibility (Su)</strong> This ability is constantly in effect, even when the living doldrums is attacking, and is not subject to <i>invisibility purge</i>. Against foes that are unable to see invisible creatures, it gains an additional +20 bonus on Stealth checks when moving, or +40 when stationary; these bonuses are not included in the statistics above. Because of its size and pervasiveness within the area it occupies, a living doldrums gains only a 20% miss chance due to its invisibility.  </p><p><strong>Stagnant Aura (Su)</strong> The air within 240 feet of a living doldrums is always still. Naturally occurring winds flow around this radius without disturbing anything inside (though precipitation falls as normal). Mundane attempts to create airflow within the aura (such as with a fan) are only half as strong as normal. Air elementals, gaseous creatures, and winged creatures (other than living doldrums) have their maneuverability reduced by one category within the aura. This aura does not inhibit magical air and wind effects.  </p><p><strong>Vulnerability to Magic Wind (Ex)</strong> Damaging effects from moving air (such as a kineticist's air blastOA) deal 50% more damage to a living doldrums. A living doldrums that begins its turn in the area of a nondamaging magical wind effect takes 1d6 points of damage per spell level of the effect.</p></div><br /><div><h4><p></p><p>When people imagine elementals that thrive on the Plane of Air, they are most likely to think of the spirits of rushing wind and thundering storm, but not all air elementals are so dynamic. Living doldrums are elementals that embody stagnant air. Those who can see invisible creatures describe the living doldrums as a cloud roughly 20 feet in diameter that resembles a knotted snake with a head at both ends. The scent of stale air lingers around a living doldrums, even if one only recently arrived to the area.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Living doldrums project an aura of unmoving air that lures those seeking shelter from the wind or becalms those who rely on wind to travel. Once it has them  trapped, the living doldrums torments its victims until they eventually kill themselves or one other. Though they do not need to eat in the traditional sense, scholars believe that living doldrums derive from their victims some sort of psychic sustenance that enables them to become more powerful.  The most dangerous aspect of these predators is their natural invisibility. They avoid direct conflict with their victims, many of which die unaware that either the dead calm of the air or the desperate actions of their allies were anything other than natural. Only when victims become aware of the living doldrums's influence-whether through magical means or mundane deduction-and take action against it does the elemental resort to physical attacks. It may be that it is the madness and not the death of its victims that feeds the living doldrums, or perhaps it merely serves them as cruel entertainment. Creatures immune to mind control are of little interest to the living doldrums, though it might use its powers to turn others against those that it can't affect directly.  Though living doldrums are resistant to many physical attacks, magic that creates wind or loud noises is especially harmful to the elementals. Spellcasters are thus often the first target of the living doldrums' mind-controlled victims. Even mundane noises are an annoyance to a living doldrums (especially percussion and wind instruments), though they cause it no damage, leading some who know of living doldrums to believe that loud or discordant music drives them off. In practice, though, this tactic is more likely to cause the elemental to physically attack the musicians, making it a dangerous but effective way to draw the creature into revealing itself.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Living doldrums are native to the Plane of Air, where they haunt trade routes, feeding on unwary or ignorant travelers until put to flight by more  powerful creatures (such as a combined force of djinn). On occasion, they slip into the Material Plane, often through temporary portals located in the eyes of hurricanes and tornadoes. Living doldrums are most often found at sea and consider sailing ships a favorite target-once trapped within the elementals' aura, sailors can do little to escape their fate. Away from the water, living doldrums make their lairs in desolate locations, such as desert oases and mountain valleys, preying on those who seek refuge there.  Though most living doldrums are concerned only with their own desires, some revere Hshurha, the elemental lord of air. These pious elementals see their actions as an extension of their god's mission to rid the multiverse of solid and visible creatures. It is rumored that a number of living doldrums serve Hshurha directly. These loyal spies gather intelligence for the Duchess of All Winds, and when necessary they use their powers to kill her enemies while making it look like death from natural causes or the work of others. These assassins would certainly have additional Hit Dice and mental powers unknown to other living doldrums.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Ruins_of_Azlant.jpg","_id":"zf09MPZj4pqLEi1g"}
