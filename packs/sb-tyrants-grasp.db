Doing so doesn't harm the jitterbone. Elongated bones are treated as masterwork armor spikes that deal damage as a weapon two size categories larger than the jitterbone. The jitterbone is considered proficient with these bone spikes and can make a bone spike attack with each hand.  </p><p><strong>Loose Bones (Ex)</strong> A jitterbone can wriggle its own loose skeleton into a tight, sinuous frame as a full-round action. It loses  its damage reduction but gains the compression universal monster ability, allowing it to squeeze through smaller spaces. It can reverse this change as a swift action.  </p><p><strong>Skeleton Scraper (Ex)</strong> A jitterbone's spikes can scar a target's skeleton. A creature damaged by a jitterbone's bone spike attack must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save or take 1 point of Strength or Dexterity damage (the jitterbone's choice). On a critical hit, this damage is instead 1d4 points of Strength or Dexterity damage. This ability damage has no effect against a creature without a skeleton. Bone scars from this ability cannot cause more than 4 points of ability damage in total to a single creature. The save DC is Strength-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Jitterbone mortics are halfling-like creatures with abnormally loose skeletons. With sufficient exertion of muscle control, jitterbones can control their skeletal structure, allowing them to shrug off crushing blows and slip through narrow spaces. They enjoy the taste of marrow- humanoid marrow in particular- and are adept at cracking and pulling their victim's bones. Jitterbones can be identified by their abnormally large heads. Their distinctive appearance and unusual appetites make jitterbones unwelcome in most halfling communities, so they form societies of their own in remote fields or forests. Among these communities of jitterbones, the most respected members are those that can contort themselves into the smallest or most awkward shapes; competitions to display this prowess and move up or down in the community's hierarchy are common. A traveler coming across one of these \"bone churning contests\" is likely to be plagued for years to come by the gruesome images of halflings twisting themselves into knots or shoving themselves through small pipes.  Jitterbones in human communities live as many halflings do: they carefully keep themselves out of the public eye but try to make themselves valuable to larger races. Unlike halflings, jitterbones don't have a particularly strong work ethic, and they therefore tend to fall into roles that require little effort, such as vagrants or ragpickers.  A typical jitterbone is 3 feet tall and weighs 35 pounds.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Tyrants_Grasp.jpg","_id":"1EUAn11NbJToobyN"}

They are usually a greenish-yellow hue, and their abdomen is covered in dozens of fluid-filled sacs in which their young gestate. A typical chelarac stands 7 feet tall, has a leg span of 10 feet, and weighs over 800 pounds.  Chelaracs are dangerous monsters that become even more dangerous as the fight goes on. Thankfully, these reclusive creatures live in isolated lairs underground or within ruins far from regular foot traffic. Some adventurers initially mistake chelaracs for araneas, often underestimating their danger.  These creatures can siphon memories from their victims, and they use this stolen knowledge to gain a better understanding of the outside world. Since they are typically encountered by explorers and adventurers, chelaracs obtain exciting and esoteric lore from their victims. Chelaracs  are also long-lived, their life spans sometimes lasting for thousands of years. Taken together, this means that chelaracs can become living libraries of obscure lore and valuable information that would otherwise be lost to the march of time. Some creatures seek out chelaracs in hopes of learning from them; few chelaracs welcome strangers into their lairs, so interested parties must bargain with the monsters for their secrets. These bargains usually involve the stranger voluntarily subjecting herself to the chelarac's bite so that the monster can siphon her memories in exchange for the sought-after lore.  Perhaps the most disturbing thing about chelaracs is the blister-like sacs that protrude from their abdomens, which hold their wriggling young. Chelaracs reproduce through parthenogenesis and thus do not require another chelarac to mate. Creepy enough by themselves, chelarac broodlings are only more terrifying in that their humanlike faces match the faces of victims from whom their parent has siphoned knowledge. The memories siphoned from victims are passed down to the young chelaracs as well. This effect can happen immediately, resulting in disturbing encounters with a chelarac. A victim of the chelarac's siphoning might be surprised to see a young chelarac emerge with his own face or that of someone the victim knows. In addition, when young chelaracs emerge they babble stolen memories, making for an uncomfortable and potentially embarrassing encounter with the brood.  A chelarac can choose when to release a broodling and can keep one in its brood sac for an indefinite amount of time. A broodling grows to its young stage and then remains in stasis until the chelarac hatches it or the sac is ruptured. Young chelaracs rarely spend more than a day with their parent before scuttling off into the darkness to find their own lair. Broodlings grow at a surprising rate, reaching full adulthood in a matter of months. Newly hatched broodlings are less reticent to share their stored memories, and strangers can more easily ask these young monsters for information.  An obscure text written by a Darklands alchemist includes a formula to make a substance that can be combined with the blood of a chelarac. The text claims that if the alchemist mixes this substance with the chelarac's blood and drinks the resulting concoction, the drinker is able to access a wealth of memories that were siphoned and stored in the monster's mind.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Tyrants_Grasp.jpg","_id":"5rItbQobCmSEiUNL"}

This functions as if they had cast <i>teleportation circle</i>, but this new route lasts for only 1 hour unless Barzahk appoints a master for the route. A master can be any willing humanoid, monstrous humanoid, fey, or outsider with at least one neutral component to its alignment, who must thereafter reside permanently along that length of the Dead Roads. A master gains Barzahk's toss thee here ashore ability while in her domain, and creatures must gain a stamp of approval from the master to use that length of the Dead Roads. A length of the Dead Roads vanishes if its master dies or is absent for more than 1 hour.  </p><p><strong>Loneliness Unbroken (Su)</strong> As a master of ways and lost things, Barzahk can decide when and if creatures leave their presence. Creatures that approach within 100 feet of Barzahk cannot leave that radius unless the usher wills it, always looping back if they flee and returning to a random point within 100 feet.  </p><p><strong>Ominous Bird of Yore (Ex)</strong> If slain within their domain, Barzahk immediately re-forms-growing from a random bird somewhere along the Dead Roads-with full hit points. They cannot use this ability for 1 month afterward.  </p><p><strong>Toss Thee Here Ashore (Su)</strong> While on the Dead Roads, Barzahk can cast <i>banishment</i> at will, treating all creatures as if they had the extraplanar subtype. Creatures successfully banished are sent either to the Material Plane or the Boneyard, at Barzahk's discretion.  </p><p><strong>Uncertain Rustling (Su)</strong> Barzahk never stands exactly where they seem to, their mastery of travel slightly displacing them even when at rest. They gain a +5 deflection bonus to AC, and all attacks targeting them have a 20% miss chance. <i>True seeing</i> and similar effects negate this miss chance, but not the deflection bonus to AC.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Barzahk the Passage is among the youngest of Pharasma's ushers, having been born alongside (or, some suggest, as) the transitive Dead Roads that psychopomps use to  travel the planes. Despite this relative youth, they still number among the oldest beings in creation, predating many archdevils, demon lords, empyreal lords, and even gods. Barzahk sees little new in this world, and a powerful boredom drives them to find wonder in small and personal things-the blooming of a flower, the rattle of a last breath, the tears of love that fall at a funeral. Whimsical and distracted, the usher rarely attends to their appointed duties for long and instead takes to wandering the planes to find new small wonders they can experience.  Even with their disregard for duty, the Passage is obsessively protective of their domain, the Dead Roads, and most of their wanderings use this realm as a path. Barzahk's awareness extends along the length and breadth of these extraplanar routes, and the usher can cast trespassers from their realm as easily as a dog shakes off water-and often with the same dispassion.  Enigmatic and distracted, Barzahk seems to have trouble recognizing individual servants and worshippers. It is appropriate that the usher of lost travelers and vigils for missing things likewise seems so lost at all times. With their master prone to long wanderings, those psychopomps who serve under the Passage enjoy an unprecedented level of <i>freedom</i> in how they carry out their duties, with many even establishing their own small domains like more powerful outsiders.  In addition to the usual army of attendant psychopomps, Barzahk commands a unique resource: the way stations and their masters that pin the Dead Roads in space and time. As such, Barzahk can call upon a strange menagerie of outsiders, fey, and experts for specialized tasks. While the various entities Barzahk appoints have no compulsion to obey the Passage, the usher can easily retract the authority they grant, denying these servants an isolated, secure home and relative power.  Barzahk normally wanders the Dead Roads among the faceless flocks of ravens, jays, vultures, and whippoorwills that infest the Dead Roads, but they sometimes assume a larger, more humanoid form. In this form, they stand just over 5 feet tall and weigh 200 pounds.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Tyrants_Grasp.jpg","_id":"7QN3N965UrZbN1MW"}

Alebrijes can take the shape of any animal or magical beast found throughout the Material Plane, though they have unique colorations and patterns all over their bodies, and some grow wings. These colorations typically include bright, vibrant hues and decorative patterns like spirals and stripes.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p> Alebrijes can form in a variety of ways. The most common is through the wishes of particularly imaginative or vivid <i>dream</i>ers, such as children and artists. These individuals subconsciously tap into the energies of the Dimension of Dreams and sometimes even visit that realm during their slumber. While in contact with these extraplanar energies, the <i>dream</i>er dreams of specific creatures, such as an animal they saw once at a carnival or an infamous monster from their homeland. These energies coalesce and suffuse that creature with the powers of the Dimension of Dreams, creating an alebrije. At times, particularly potent <i>dream</i>ers can cause an alebrije to form even when the creature they're <i>dream</i>ing of no longer lives, such as a childhood pet or a slain monster, or is purely imaginary.  Other times, a creature may transform into an alebrije if it wanders into a place where the border between the Material and Ethereal Planes is thin. Such planar borderlands allow creatures to enter the Dimension of Dreams, where exposure to the dimension's strange powers changes the beings into alebrijes. Most creatures that visit the dimension in this way end up remaining there, preferring the unique landscapes to their relatively mundane homes. Because of this, alebrijes are commonplace throughout the dimension, which is why they so often appear in peoples' dreams.  In the most rare cases, an alebrije can form when an animal or magical beast learns lucid <i>dream</i>ing. The minds of these creatures create subconscious connections to the Dimension of Dreams that lead to a gradual transformation. In some cases, these creatures may be part of a lineage that included an alebrije, much in the same way a sorcerer may have a dragon or demon in her lineage. This bloodline connection to an alebrije helps push the creature past the tipping point of their <i>dream</i>ing capabilities.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Some alebrijes are content to continue their lives in their home environments, using their connection to the Dimension of Dreams to travel throughout the Material Plane. Others use their improved mental and physical abilities to rise as the superior member of their pack or the apex predator in their region, retreating to the Dimension of Dreams only to rest. Still others find that their newfound knowledge inspires them to visit the dreams of other creatures.  House pets and local legends that become alebrijes tend to visit the individuals who took care of them or brought them into being. These alebrijes serve as guardians and mentors, particularly to small children, and move on when their charge no longer needs their guidance. Alebrijes with a particularly strong connection to an individual may even search for the mortal's soul once that person has passed into the Boneyard, protecting the soul from astral predators and easing its transition into the afterlife, much like a psychopomp.  <br /><strong>CREATING AN ALEBRIJE</strong><br />  \"Alebrije\" is an acquired template that can be added to any animal or magical beast (referred to hereafter as the base creature). An alebrije uses the base creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted here.  <br /><strong>Challenge Rating:</strong> Base creature's CR + 2.  <br /><strong>Size:</strong> An alebrije with 8 Hit Dice or more increases in size by one category.  <br /><strong>Type:</strong> The creature's type changes to magical beast (extraplanar). Do not recalculate its base attack bonus, saves, or skill ranks.  <br /><strong>Senses:</strong> The creature gains darkvision with a range of 120 feet, dreamsight, and scent.  <br /><i>Dreamsight (Su)</i>: Alebrijes are able to notice and locate sleeping creatures within 500 feet, as well as creatures engaged in similar rest, such as meditation or resting trances.  <br /><strong>Armor Class:</strong> Natural armor bonus increases by 2.  <br /><strong>Hit Dice:</strong> Change all the creature's racial Hit Dice to d10s. Hit Dice derived from class levels remain unchanged.  <br /><strong>Defensive Abilities:</strong> An alebrije with 5 Hit Dice or more gains DR 5/magic (or DR 10/magic if it has 11 Hit Diceor more) and SR equal to its new CR + 6 (or SR equal to its new CR + 11 if it has 11 Hit Dice or more). In addition, an alebrije gains cold resistance 5 and fire resistance 5 (or cold resistance 10 and fire resistance 10 if it has 11 Hit Dice or more). Finally, an alebrije gains light <i>fortification</i>, as the <i>fortification</i> armor special ability.  <br /><strong>Speed:</strong> An alebrije with 5 Hit Dice or more grows wings and gains a fly speed of 20 feet (average). If the alebrije has 11 Hit Dice or more, it gains a fly speed of 40 feet (average) instead. An alebrije that already has a fly speed improves its maneuverability by one step instead.  <br /><strong>Melee:</strong> An alebrije's natural attacks grow mighty and fantastical. Increase the damage die of the base creature's primary natural attacks by one step. An alebrije's natural attacks are considered magical for the purposes of damage reduction.  <br /><strong>Spell-like Abilities:</strong> An alebrije gains the following spell-like abilities, using its Charisma modifier to determine any save DCs: 3/day-<i>dream</i>, <i>nightmare</i>; 1/day- <i>dream</i> council, <i>dream</i> travel, <i>mind thrust III</i>, <i>plane shift</i> (self plus 50 lbs. of objects only). The caster level equals the creature's HD (or the caster level of the base creature's spell-like abilities, whichever is higher).  <br /><strong>Ability Scores:</strong> Str +4, Dex +6, Con +4, Int +4, Wis +6, Cha +4.  <br /><strong>Skills:</strong> Alebrijes have a +8 racial bonus on Knowledge (arcana) and Knowledge (planes) checks. They always treat these skills as class skills. Otherwise,their skills are the same as the base creatures'.  <br /><strong>Languages:</strong> An alebrije gains telepathy (100 ft.) and can speak one language of its choice.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Tyrants_Grasp.jpg","_id":"8VMSa9wXF73KJ44G"}

A calaca who returns to the Boneyard for 24 consecutive hours acquires a new guitar to replace the one that it has destroyed. This is a sonic, mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Calacas are unusual psychopomps in that their purview is not the dead, but the survivors who must carry on in the dead's absence. A calaca's purpose is to abate the sorrow of family members and loved ones of the recently departed. It accomplishes this by way of soothing wisdom and its celebration of the deceased's life through song. Although mortals who know calacas' true nature may think them simply magnanimous spirits, these psychopomps have a very pragmatic reason for soothing the aggrieved, which is to dissuade any with the know-how or desire from attempting to raise the dead using necromancy or other foul means.  In order to mingle with mortals without alerting them to its nature, a calaca disguises itself from head to toe in local finery, wearing gloves and colorful masks to hide its true nature. Beneath its facade, a calaca resembles a large skeleton, its bones a somber gray. A typical calaca stands around 6 feet tall and weighs only 40 pounds.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p> Many cultures speak of kindly strangers or masked wanderers who appear in the wake of a beloved's death to offer words of consolation and songs of catharsis, and calacas are often the root of these myths. A calaca typically arrives at the door of a widow, widower, or next of kin by mysterious means and always claims to be a distant friend or admirer of the dead. The calaca may show up during a wake or other funeral procession-as long as doing so would not be disruptive or insulting-bearing food and drink for the mourners. While they treat the bereaved to sustenance and music, calacas use their social charms to get to know the grieving and to learn more about the deceased so that they can tailor their consolations to each individual. Because they use no compulsion magic and cannot speak with the dead like some psychopomps, calacas must rely on their natural graces and aptitude for conversation while interacting with mortals.  meet the spirits of the dead for whom they are sharing consolations), but from the pain of knowing that mortals will never fully understand the beauty or necessity of the transition from life to death. They are a forlorn race of psychopomps who express their sorrow in the form of joyful music and mirthful laughter.  A calaca's role is not in combat, and most retreat if a fight seems inevitable, returning another day to give peaceful mediation another try. In spite of calacas' pacifistic nature, each bears on its person an antique weapon such as a pistol or an exotic sword, which is perhaps the creature's most mysterious detail. Even the calaca does not know the purpose of this weapon-whether it is a relic from the creature's past as a mortal or just part of its disguise. However, if asked, a calaca replies that its weapon is an item gifted directly by the gods, and its use will become obvious when the appropriate time has come. A calaca's second-most important belonging is its instrument (typically a guitar or fiddle), which is capable of unleashing powerful magic if destroyed as a last resort.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  A calaca's prime directive is to discreetly dissuade any survivors who might consider necromancy or other unnatural means of reviving the dead. Calacas accomplish this through tact and persuasion, not magic or trickery, and by instilling the belief that death is simply a second chapter in the story of one's life. If a calaca cannot sway a mortal from trying to revive the fallen, it calls upon other psychopomps more suited to handling the threat.  Because death is common on Golarion but necromancy is not, calacas do not appear before just anyone who has lost a loved one. Their typical targets are the rich and powerful; after all, individuals with the resources to bring the living back from the dead often need more dissuasion than peasants without means, who simply resign themselves to their loss. For particularly difficult cases or in the instance of mass casualties and thus multitudes of mourners, a number of calacas may band together to combine their efforts, appearing as a troupe. Such troupes typically throw elaborate performative feasts, with each calaca taking up a different instrument or part in the act. As long as their disguise holds, calacas will perform for mortals for days if necessary. Other psychopomps like catrinas may also join them in larger groups, as their abilities complement the calacas' by calming distraught family members and angry mobs.  When not performing their core duty consoling the aggrieved, calacas accompany other psychopomps on missions to the Material Plane, either as heralds or to  Far from mere charlatans, calacas do in actuality feel the sympathy they express so strongly to survivors of the dead. However, their grief stems not from the departure of the individual to the afterlife (in fact, most calacas never  provide support. A calaca typically reports its success or failures to a nosoi, who scribbles details of the calaca's latest encounter with a mortal. When a morrigna has been given a target for assassination, several calacas may be sent in advance to soften the morrigna's prey before the attack. Calacas can also be found in the backs of the ranks of vanth forces, maintaining the pace of the psychopomps' march with their haunting battle dirges. Truly, wherever there are psychopomps, the somber songs of the calaca are never far behind.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Tyrants_Grasp.jpg","_id":"AMg6fA3q0BOkCnTu"}

If the gurgist ends her movement adjacent to an enemy, that enemy is flat-footed against the gurgist until the beginning of the gurgist's next turn.  </p><p><strong>Obsession Skill (Ex)</strong> Every gurgist has some hobby or activity or skill she uses to keep the hunger away, and which she  swiftly masters. A gurgist selects one of the following skills: Appraise, Climb, Craft, Disable Device, Disguise, Handle Animal, Heal, Knowledge (any), Linguistics, Perform, Profession, Ride, Sleight of Hand, Spellcraft, Stealth, Survival, Swim, or Use Magic Device. That skill is a class skill for the gurgist. She gains Skill Focus and Signature Skill (<i>Pathfinder RPG Pathfinder Unchained</i> 82) as bonus feats for this chosen skill, and she can reroll a failed check with her obsession skill once per day. This gurgist has chosen Craft (leatherworking) as her obsession skill.  </p><p><strong>Rotting Flesh (Su)</strong> Gurgists are forever slowly rotting, their flesh growing soft and discolored and eventually sloughing off in rancid slabs. <i>The</i> only way a gurgist can arrest this decay is to consume raw meat. A gurgist begins to rot if she goes more than 1 week without eating roughly 10% of her body weight in raw meat. After 1 week, she takes 1 point of Constitution damage and 1 point of Charisma damage each day until she can feed. This damage cannot be healed until the gurgist has fed. A <i>gentle repose</i> spell extends the amount of time a gurgist can go without feeding for the duration of the spell.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>A gurgist mortic is a keen mind trapped within a rotting, hungering body. Gurgists can feel the decay of their flesh, just as they can feel the urgings of their gullet to rend and consume meat until they bloat with it. But unlike zombies and other carnivorous undead, mortics still have their wits about them and use their minds to find solutions to their nature. <i>The</i>y hunt and herd to keep the rot at bay, they obsess over crafts or skills to distract from the hunger, and they wear extravagant masks and colorful garments to hide their hideousness.  Gurgists are the same size as humans, averaging 5-1/2 to 6 feet tall, and weighing about 160 pounds.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p> Gurgists are among the more common mortics, created whenever a human being is afflicted with a little too much negative energy. A zombie's bite will do the trick, but so too will a mummy's curse or a necromancer's enchantment, giving rise to a metaphysical anomaly that causes the gurgist's body to think itself dead and free to rot. <i>The</i> body first grows pale, and then develops purple-red splotches on its skin as the blood stills and stagnates. If the gurgist isn't careful, her flesh then grows gray or waxy and begins to rot, with hideous sores opening. A gurgist who allows this to persist will eventually see large parts of her body liquefy, which usually proves fatal to the gurgist in question.  <i>The</i> only way for a gurgist to stop the process is to eat raw meat-the more, the better. Through some occult means, the gurgist's half-dead biology then repairs itself and can even reverse smaller changes. A recently fed gurgist can mostly pass for a human, albeit a pale and  sickly one, and gurgists who deal with the living are scrupulous in maintaining a daily feeding schedule.  As part of their cursed biology, gurgists suffer from a powerful hunger for meat, preferably fresh raw meat or offal. This hunger is a constant, gnawing sensation at the back of a gurgist's mind, and while it doesn't drive her to madness, it certainly drives her to distraction. Luckily for all involved, gurgists have at best a very mild preference for human flesh, and so most subsist on enormous quantities of raw beef, pork, or wild game.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Few gurgists can pass for long in mortal society. <i>The</i>ir unceasing rot marks them, and their dietary needs limit them. Instead, most live in small villages out on the outskirts of civilization, in wild lands where law breaks down and a community of masked half-dead can live, if not unnoticed, then at least unmolested.  Gurgist villages devote great effort to dealing with the twin problems of rot and hunger. Gurgists ensure there is always plenty of meat around, and so they often become herders and hunters. Many extend their animal-tending skills to other beasts as well. Gurgists are infinitely creative when it comes to taming the local wildlife, and their half-dead hardiness means they can risk dealing with creatures that other people would avoid, such as ankhegs, chimeras, griffons, and mammoths. Gurgists also think of weaker undead as just one more type of beast to train, though no gurgist willingly deals with zombies of any stripe- the similarities are simply too close for comfort.  Dealing with the hunger is harder. Most gurgist communities use distraction to keep themselves sane. Gurgists find a hobby or activity and focus all their will and drive on that one thing, until it becomes greater in their minds than their hunger. Gurgists might become master animal trainers or leatherworkers, painters, carvers, poets, or anything else that keeps the edge of hunger at bay. In some gurgist villages, all residents choose the same mania, elevating it to something akin to a religion. More often, they each pursue their own private obsessions, placing their skills in the service of their communities.  Masks and clothing are vital parts of gurgist culture. While there are exceptions, most gurgists find their slow rot no more pleasing to the eye than outsiders do. <i>The</i>y instead make beautiful and colorful garb, with particular emphasis placed on unique and eye-catching masks. Gurgists wear their masks constantly, tying them with leather bands or in extreme cases even sewing them to their half-rotted flesh, and many gurgists consider their masks to be their true faces. Gurgist masks also often say something about the gurgists' roles in their community.  Hunters or warriors have small, elegant masks, while artisans have more extravagant masks adorned with symbols of their trade.  Gurgist communities tend to be standoffish but not actively hostile to others in the area. In wilder areas, such as in the depths of the Mwangi Expanse or near the Crown of the World, gurgists are sometimes even accepted as neighbors by local human communities-not necessarily comfortable or friendly, but as allies against more dangerous forces.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Tyrants_Grasp.jpg","_id":"Cj6Soctpo6JqMFP4"}

A chelarac can release only up to 1d6 broodlings each day.  </p><p><strong>Siphon Knowledge (Su)</strong> A chelarac can drain knowledge from its victims. Any intelligent creature that takes damage from a chelarac's bite must succeed at a DC 19 Will save or have 1d6 hours of its memory absorbed by the chelarac. The target creature still retains its memories, but it might recall some of the details incorrectly. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Chelaracs appear as enormous spiders that have a human head with spiderlike mouthparts. They are usually a greenish-yellow hue, and their abdomen is covered in dozens of fluid-filled sacs in which their young gestate. A typical chelarac stands 7 feet tall, has a leg span of 10 feet, and weighs over 800 pounds.  Chelaracs are dangerous monsters that become even more dangerous as the fight goes on. Thankfully, these reclusive creatures live in isolated lairs underground or within ruins far from regular foot traffic. Some adventurers initially mistake chelaracs for araneas, often underestimating their danger.  These creatures can siphon memories from their victims, and they use this stolen knowledge to gain a better understanding of the outside world. Since they are typically encountered by explorers and adventurers, chelaracs obtain exciting and esoteric lore from their victims. Chelaracs  are also long-lived, their life spans sometimes lasting for thousands of years. Taken together, this means that chelaracs can become living libraries of obscure lore and valuable information that would otherwise be lost to the march of time. Some creatures seek out chelaracs in hopes of learning from them; few chelaracs welcome strangers into their lairs, so interested parties must bargain with the monsters for their secrets. These bargains usually involve the stranger voluntarily subjecting herself to the chelarac's bite so that the monster can siphon her memories in exchange for the sought-after lore.  Perhaps the most disturbing thing about chelaracs is the blister-like sacs that protrude from their abdomens, which hold their wriggling young. Chelaracs reproduce through parthenogenesis and thus do not require another chelarac to mate. Creepy enough by themselves, chelarac broodlings are only more terrifying in that their humanlike faces match the faces of victims from whom their parent has siphoned knowledge. The memories siphoned from victims are passed down to the young chelaracs as well. This effect can happen immediately, resulting in disturbing encounters with a chelarac. A victim of the chelarac's siphoning might be surprised to see a young chelarac emerge with his own face or that of someone the victim knows. In addition, when young chelaracs emerge they babble stolen memories, making for an uncomfortable and potentially embarrassing encounter with the brood.  A chelarac can choose when to release a broodling and can keep one in its brood sac for an indefinite amount of time. A broodling grows to its young stage and then remains in stasis until the chelarac hatches it or the sac is ruptured. Young chelaracs rarely spend more than a day with their parent before scuttling off into the darkness to find their own lair. Broodlings grow at a surprising rate, reaching full adulthood in a matter of months. Newly hatched broodlings are less reticent to share their stored memories, and strangers can more easily ask these young monsters for information.  An obscure text written by a Darklands alchemist includes a formula to make a substance that can be combined with the blood of a chelarac. The text claims that if the alchemist mixes this substance with the chelarac's blood and drinks the resulting concoction, the drinker is able to access a wealth of memories that were siphoned and stored in the monster's mind.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Tyrants_Grasp.jpg","_id":"FduRumWJqGkM4ERj"}

A character attempting to use magical healing on a creature damaged  by a nightprowler's creeping dark must succeed at a DC 26 caster level check, or the healing has no effect on the injured creature. As long as a creature suffers the creeping dark, its vision is obscured with shadows as well-all creatures gain a 20% miss chance from attacks by the victim. The creeping dark is a curse effect that lasts until removed or until all damage to the victim is healed. The save DC is Charisma-based. </p><p><strong>Shadowpounce (Su)</strong> Nightprowlers have the pounce ability, and when they use this ability, they can also make rake attacks.

This tongue attack has a reach of 25 feet. The attack deals no damage but allows the furcifer to grab its target. A furcifer does not gain the grappled condition while using its tongue in this manner.  </p><p><strong>Utopia (Sp)</strong> A furcifer is blessed with strange powers of illusion and can warp the world around it at will to seem idyllic and safe. This functions as a <i>mirage arcana</i> spell, though the furcifer's simplistic intellect means it may create unusual or surreal illusions based on what its victims find appealing. Creatures in the affected area may recognize the landscape as unnatural with a successful DC 20 Will saving throw; otherwise, the furcifer's powers lull them into accepting the impossible. Affected creatures cannot recognize any natural hazards in the area, and the furcifer itself appears as something harmless within the affected area, such as a flower-covered hill, quaint home, or friendly animal, making it effectively invisible; if the furcifer attacks, it immediately breaks the invisibility effect but does not end the <i>mirage arcana</i> effect. Creatures immune to illusions and mind-affecting effects are immune to this effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Standing as tall as a house and draped in intoxicating blossoms, the furcifer is a bizarre synthesis of reptile and plant born from enormous surges of positive energy. Despite their inviting, vibrant hides, furcifers are ravenous predators, capable of warping the world around them into almost any placid scene and concealing themselves from ordinary senses. These abilities make them extraordinary ambush predators, and parties of human-sized travelers are easily picked off one by one from above thanks to the clever reptilian hunters' long, prehensile tongues.  Lazy and patient, these large reptiles sometimes lull whole caravans into complacency, letting them linger in false wonderlands for days or weeks as the furcifer picks off its prey one at a time. Furcifers are cantankerous and stubborn, and dispense with all subtlety to pursue prey relentlessly if it escapes their illusory paradise.  Furcifers on average stand over 15 feet tall and 35 feet long thanks to their long, curled tails. Furcifers weigh up to 6-1/2 tons.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p> A primordial creature of incredible size and impressive innate magic, the furcifer blends reptile and plant features into the form of a deadly ambush hunter. With the frame of a massive, hunchbacked lizard, opposable claws on each limb, a long prehensile tail, and a bony crest to protect their neck, this vicious beast lacks little in comparison to other predators. Despite all this, furcifers are lazy and capricious, preferring to lie in wait and snatch smaller prey with their long, prehensile tongues. Their  broad-set eyes can rotate independently, allowing them to look in multiple directions at once and constantly watch for other dangerous creatures.  Furcifers command impressive innate magic that allows them to cloak the world around them in a placid disguise. They have rudimentary psychic abilities and can read glimpses of whatever their prey finds inviting and harmless, and then spin those stolen images into a soft landscape. When confronting intelligent creatures, the beasts' limited intellects sometimes result in surreal illusions-such as fruit trees heavy with bunnies, rippling ponds sitting at angles in hillsides, or houses made from candy- but the mind-numbing euphoria of their magic often makes such impossible landscapes feel sensible to their unsuspecting prey.  The orchidlike plants growing from the furcifer's back help further define their abilities. Rather than a symbiotic relationship, the blossoms are as much a part of the predator's anatomy as its eyes or claws, and they secrete a sweetly scented narcotic pollen that lulls most warm-blooded animals into a mild euphoria. The plants provide some sustenance to the furcifer but also produce a bevy of alchemical reagents that help power its magical abilities as well as its consumption. With the aid of these botanical factories, furcifers can digest practically anything they can swallow- from rocks and debris to armor worn by their prey.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Furcifers flourish in warm and temperate forests, as their cold-blooded nature and hothouse flower elements make them vulnerable to the cold. The resilient creatures could survive in desert and mountain environments if transplanted, limited only by available water and prey, but they rarely leave the familiar hunting grounds where they are born.  As asexual creatures, furcifers rely on pollinating insects for reproduction. Once their blossoms are fertilized, they release their spore-like eggs into the wind, and  those that settle on trees develop into small, carnivorous flowers that feed on their host trees and passing insects and birds for several years before maturing into miniature furcifers that begin hunting. The youngs' first meals often consist of other larval furcifers that have yet to mature into their ambulatory states. On rare occasion, a single larval bloom will produce twin young, who bond and share their territory for life.  Infused with positive energy and strange alchemical reagents, furcifers are useful components for a variety of projects. Their pollen remains psychoactive for years after death, and the nectar harvested from a single beast can provides weeks' worth of potent hallucinogens. Their bones are coveted for magic items involving acid, and their skin can be readily fashioned into cloaks and robes with illusory properties. The flesh itself is mildly toxic, and dead furcifers may rot slowly for months rather than be scavenged by other animals.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Tyrants_Grasp.jpg","_id":"Gf1ZCPHEwvwsAHC5"}

The kaicharek loses its Dexterity bonus to AC (reducing its AC to 15), but it holds on with great tenacity and automatically inflicts its blood drain each round. A kaicharek has a +8 racial bonus to maintain its grapple on a foe once it is attached. An attached kaicharek can still be attacked. The grappled creature remains unaware of the kaicharek as if under the effects of the kaicharek's <i>hidden presence</i> spell-like ability, but it can attempt a DC 15 Will save to notice the signs of the kaicharek's feeding. The grappled creature gains a cumulative +1 bonus on its Will save for every round the kaicharek remains attached. Other creatures can notice the kaicharek by succeeding at a DC 15 Perception check. The DC is Constitution-based.  </p><p><strong>Impaling Thrust (Ex)</strong> A kaicharek can engage specific muscles in its body to violently thrust its bladed tentacles out at foes as a swift action. For the following round, the  kaicharek increases the reach of its tentacle attacks to 10 feet. This act misaligns the musculature of its tentacles and the kaicharek thereafter loses the use of its tentacle attacks until it spends a move action to retract them.  </p><p><strong>Slashing Talons (Ex)</strong> The tips of a kaicharek's tentacles are covered in serrated bone blades, causing them to deal slashing damage and bleed damage instead of bludgeoning damage.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>With slashing tentacles and a blood-hungry maw, kaichareks lie in wait for the foolish entering Achaekek's realm, ambushing and exsanguinating the weak and grabbing a quick meal from the strong. This latter feature has earned kaichareks the name \"parasites of Achaekek.\" Though hardly the strongest creatures associated with the Mantis God, kaichareks are vicious yet cowardly creatures that seem to live for the anguish and bloodshed they unleash on the world around them.  A typical kaicharek is 5 feet long and weighs 270 pounds.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p> Kaichareks seem to live only to hunt, digesting only some of the blood and gore they consume from prey and storing the rest in their thick bodies to be digested later during lean times. This seeming lack of reliance on consumption has led some planar scholars to theorize that kaichareks derive sustenance from some other source, possibly the psychic trauma their attacks cause.  When hunting, the kaicharek uses two different methods depending on the size of its prey. Against prey the same size as the kaicharek or smaller, the creature strikes from hiding or by using its magical ability to hide its presence from others. It lashes out with its razor-tipped tentacles and bites, attempting to grapple its prey. When it gets ahold of a victim, it devours it as messily as possible, thrashing about violently and reveling in its bloody meal.  The second method of hunting is reserved for much larger prey that a kaicharek believes is alone. The kaicharek still attacks from hiding, but instead of merely biting its prey, it activates a more focused version of its magical abilities, hiding itself from its prey's awareness and hanging on as a leech or other similar parasite. This feeding continues until its prey collapses, exsanguinated, or it discovers the kaicharek. The latter usually occurs when the parasite spills the excess blood onto the nearby ground, which not even the kaicharek's magical stealth can hide.  If either of these methods fail, or their prey proves more formidable than anticipated, the kaicharek immediately flees, burrowing underground if possible. The cowardly creature rarely stays away for long, however, seeking to finish off weakened prey or exact bloody revenge for its humiliation.  One of the more vicious abilities associated with these predators is their ability to overextend their tentacles to attack from a greater range-a feat accomplished by a combination of muscle spasms, fluidic action, and tearing of the internal ligaments holding the tentacle together. After overextending its tentacles, a kaicharek must spend a few seconds retracting the tentacles back and activating a focused, specialized healing ability to repair the internal damage. A kaicharek can even regrow a severed tentacle, although this process takes several hours.  Kaichareks are an autogamous species and self-fertilize, laying their eggs in pools of blood left behind by their own attacks or in bloody remnants left by larger predators. When blood is plentiful, a single kaicharek can produce dozens of offspring in a few months.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  The parasites of Achaekek can be found anywhere in the Blood Vale, Achaekek's realm in the tunnels beneath Pharasma's Boneyard, and their preferred hunting grounds always have plenty of soft soil and hiding places in which to stalk and ambush prey. Kaichareks sometimes wander into the Boneyard, though these expeditions rarely last long, as patrols of vanth and esobok psychopomps slay kaichareks on sight. Other kaichareks make their way to the Material Plane, either through thinned planar boundaries or by way of mortal conjurers.  Normally solitary hunters, kaichareks only rarely associate with others of their own kind, often treating each other as prey. However, during lean times, the blood-hungry beasts band together, ambushing larger groups, overlapping their magical stealth to confuse prey, or even overwhelming a single massive target in hopes of bringing it down. Exactly how kaichareks communicate is difficult to determine, but they seem to use gestures and traced messages written in blood. Regardless, such alliances last only until food becomes more plentiful or the kaichareks become hungry enough to turn against one another.  Kaichareks do not realize it, but they are at the core of a split among Achaekek's worshippers. As kaichareks are known to infest Achaekek's realm, some worshippers of the Mantis God summon them in a misguided attempt to gain favor with the indifferent Achaekek. The cult of the Red Mantis, on the other hand, holds a particular disdain for kaichareks. They view the parasites as utterly lacking in strategy or resourcefulness, despite their intelligence. Worse, most kaichareks' tendencies to indiscriminately parasitize  stronger creatures violates the cult's philosophy of holding leaders or rulers in high regard. The fact that kaichareks don't recognize this hierarchy marks them as worse than beasts in the cult's eyes.  The exact relationship between Achaekek and these parasites is unknown. It seems unlikely that the creatures are creations of the Mantis God, as creating entirely new races is uncharacteristic of the bloodthirsty deity. One theory holds that Achaekek discovered kaichareks on some Material Plane world, took a liking to them, and transported some of their race back to his domain. For their part, kaichareks look upon their deific patron with a mixture of fear and awe, viewing him as an apex predator that they know can snatch them up as morsels. Some kaichareks dare to feed upon Achaekek directly, and those that aren't immediately destroyed for this hubris gain quasi-divine powers, setting them above their brute kin.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Tyrants_Grasp.jpg","_id":"Jk8lAc4CODkLOyIS"}

If a creature was already fatigued when it fails this save, it becomes exhausted instead. The save DC is Constitution-based.  </p><p><strong>Voidfury (Ex)</strong> Sceazirs have an instinctive loathing for positive energy.

Though they possess only an animalistic intelligence, sceazirs loathe all forms of life and unlife and are quick to hunt down anything they detect in their territory that is not native to the Negative Energy Plane. They are unnaturally fast, moving with equal ease on the ground or through the air. Due to sceazirs' speed and skill at tracking, sceaduinars often use them as mounts or beasts of burden. Sceazirs can understand the commands of a sceaduinar rider through a telepathic bond and carry out such commands obediently, but they almost never accept non-sceaduinar riders.  A sceazir is typically 11 feet long, stands 6 feet tall at the shoulder, and weighs about 900 pounds.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p> Scholars are unsure of the exact catalysts that cause the \"births\" of the Negative Energy Plane's strange entropic creatures, and due to the plane's hostile environment, attempts to study the subject are difficult and limited. Like sceaduinars, sceazirs are born from crystalline formations made of the Negative Energy Plane's hypersaturation of negative energy, hatching fully grown from egg-like cocoons. Academics speculate that the similarities in this creation process are what form the connection that allows sceaduinars to telepathically command sceazirs.  Sceazirs' bodies are formed of dark purple crystal, and their heads are somewhat wolflike, though with mouths far wider than those of any mortal canines. Their six many-jointed, insectile legs, terminating in jagged claws, give them an unnerving, skittering appearance when moving across the ground. In flight, their wings vibrate at a speed not easily discernible by the mortal eye, so they appear to be completely still even as they swoop down on victims. Their speed, stealth, and ability to sense living creatures make them highly efficient predators.  It is rumored that even larger and more powerful sceazirs inhabit the dark reaches of the Negative Energy Plane, though if such creatures do exist, none who have encountered them survived to verify these rumors.   <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  As bestial creatures driven primarily by instinctual hatred, sceazirs do not have anything that could properly be called a society of their own. They are often influenced more by sceaduinars than their own inclinations. Though the egg formations containing sceazirs arise spontaneously, sceaduinars residing in the area typically tend them to ensure the eggs hatch safely. This process also ensures that the newly birthed sceazirs bond to the attending sceaduinars, providing a ready source of mounts when needed. A sceazir is loyal to its sceaduinar rider, although the bond is not necessarily exclusive; sceazirs take commands from any sceaduinar, provided they do not conflict with the commands of a sceaduinar that is already commanding them. It is unusual to see more than a single sceazir and sceaduinar together, however, and the presence of multiple pairs always indicates they are joining together against something they consider to be a significant threat.  Sceazirs birthed into the harsh wilds of the Negative Energy Plane are left to their own devices unless found by a sceaduinar with a need for their service. These sceazirs roam the plane hunting for prey, often forming packs. Packs have a loose hierarchy, with the strongest sceazir in the group acting as the leader, without other defined roles. Although they have no real need to eat, they enjoy seeking out both living and undead creatures to devour, gleefully tearing their prey to pieces. The relative rarity of intruders to the Negative Energy Plane means that sceazirs eagerly track down any new arrivals they detect in their territory. They especially loathe those capable of using positive energy and target such foes with particular ferocity.  Whether they are solitary or part of a pack, sceazirs mark their territory by digging nests out of the entropic substance that forms the Negative Energy Plane's environs. Sceazir nests generally take the form of caves or deep pits, and they can be identified by the swirled, geometrical patterns of claw marks across the ground and exterior. These patterns are unique to each sceazir or pack, and they cause a disturbing sense of vertigo to living creatures who look into them for too long.  Curiously, sceazirs seem to have an inborn terror of the Negative Energy Plane's other inhabitants, nightshades. This aversion goes far beyond that of sceaduinars, who despise  nightshades and avoid them unless they have sufficient power or numbers to ensure success in the ensuing conflict. Sceazirs will not approach a nightshade or its territory under any circumstances, even if directly commanded to do so by a sceaduinar rider. Speculations regarding the reason for this vary. Some scholars believe it is a simple matter of practicality, as the majority of sceazirs are not powerful enough to survive a conflict with a nightshade. Others, however, suspect the phobia may have a deeper cause, with suggestions ranging from an energy given off by nightshades that sceazirs cannot tolerate to an ancient war ending in the sceazirs' defeat and devolution to the bestial creatures they are now. Some have even suggested that nightshades are capable of commanding sceazirs just as sceaduinars are, but use that ability to keep sceazirs away rather than work with them.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Tyrants_Grasp.jpg","_id":"MAaHBkhQPu1Yf7Qf"}

Each troop of profaned paladins gains one of the following benefits.  <i>Alchemical Reanimation (Ex)</i> The troop consists largely of Moloum's alchemically animated undead, all of which expel toxic chemicals when harmed. The troop is immune to acid damage. If a creature damages the troop with a natural attack, unarmed strike, or non-reach melee weapon, that creature takes 2d6 acid damage  and must succeed at a DC 25 Fortitude save or be sickened for 1 round. The save DC is Charisma-based.  <i>Petrified Preservation (Ex)</i> The troop consists largely of petrified creatures that Aeonte unpetrified, killed, and then animated as undead. The process leaves the creatures' bones petrified and durable, giving the troop DR 10/- instead of DR 5/bludgeoning.  <i>Unholy Ward (Su)</i> The troop consists largely of Klrau's blasphemous creations protected by Baalzebul's hellish power. The troop is immune to fire damage and gains a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws.</p></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Tyrants_Grasp.jpg","_id":"MvKJTDXqgLlCJ5jA"}

In addition to its normal modifications, it can  use <i>modify memory</i> to grant the knowledge of a particular skill to a creature. When using the ability in this way, the mix couatl chooses one of the following skills: Craft (any), Handle Animal, Heal, Knowledge (engineering), Knowledge (geography), Knowledge (nature), Profession (any), Ride, Spellcraft, Survival, or Use Magic Device. The target of the spell automatically gains a number of ranks in that skill equal to its Hit Dice (maximum 5 ranks) and treats that skill as a class skill. The target creature retains the skill ranks for up to 1 month, after which the creature loses the skill ranks but still treats the chosen skill as a class skill.

In addition, its fly speed increases to 80 feet (perfect) at night.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Mix (pronounced \"meesh\") couatls are a variety of couatl known for their ability to grant <i>guidance</i> and knowledge to fledgling societies. They seek out less established tribes and villages and offer their knowledge to help such settlements flourish. A mix couatl can offer a variety of knowledge depending on the nature of the settlement and its people. To some, they offer knowledge of new farming and hunting techniques, while others are taught more esoteric knowledge, like the arcane arts. While nurturing a settlement, a mix couatl typically acts as its protector, keeping at bay any foes that would disrupt the growth of the people. A typical mix couatl is 12 feet long with a wingspan of 15 feet and weighs 1,500 pounds.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p> Mix couatls are among the most common couatls known across Golarion, alongside their auwaz couatl cousins (see page 82). The scales of a mix couatl are dotted with small white and light gray spots that resemble the stars in the sky and red stripes that resemble the final rays of a setting sun. Their feathers range in color from dark blues to deep violets to blacks darker than the night. This coloring resembles the colors of the twilight and helps a mix couatl hide among the stars at night. The flapping of their wings as they fly through the skies is said to resemble the sounds of distant thunder. Many who know of mix couatls or recognize this sound claim that the noise is very calming, as it is both a reminder of relaxing summer rains and of the couatls' protection.  Each mix couatl is gifted with the knowledge of the rest of its brothers and sisters, though it does not have access to this knowledge on an individual basis. Instead, a mix couatl can call upon bits of knowledge to share with others, much as one might pluck a star from the night sky. The mix couatl can bless an individual with this knowledge, even though the couatl itself may not know the full details of the gift it grants. This shared knowledge allows mix couatls to work together and aid each other even if they never meet face to face, a lesson that they also teach to others. Individual mix couatls may have different skills from those listed above, depending on their own experience and expertise.  Mix couatls are among the couatls with the longest life spans. Though they don't live as long as xiuh couatls (<i>Pathfinder Adventure Path #106</i> 86), their legacy can live on for centuries thanks to the knowledge they share with others. When a mix couatl reaches the final years of its life, it lays a small clutch of eggs, which typically hatch up to half a dozen couatls.  Although they are more than capable hunters on their own, many mix couatls have grown accustomed to receiving gifts of fruit, vegetables, and livestock from the first harvests of a settlement. As such, many stories state that earning a mix couatl's favor requires a single sweet fruit.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Mix couatls find their own kind somewhat abrasive. Every mix couatl has its own belief as to what a settlement requires, and many mix couatls find themselves disagreeing with their kin on such matters. They each mark the settlements they are aiding by marking them with starlike beacons, and keep away from each others' territory to avoid bickering.  When assisting a settlement, a mix couatl tends to share knowledge about the natural world to assist with farming and hunting methods. Thanks to this knowledge, many see mix couatls as demigods of the hunt. Some claim that mix couatls were present during the early days of Golarion to help guide humanity by providing knowledge of fire and magic. With this knowledge, the first humans were able to learn how to make war, so some humans also consider mix couatls to be demigods of war-a reputation mix couatls have worked hard to escape in the millennia since.  Although they are altruistic as a whole, mix couatls are known for having fun with their duties, often sharing less relevant or  risky knowledge to shake up the growth of a settlement. Many tales tell of mix couatls teaching small children about magic or places that then cause trouble for a settlement. In the end, most settlements find that these challenges teach great lessons and use this valuable knowledge to improve their settlements in unexpected ways.  Mix couatls commonly return to the sites of settlements they have helped nurture over the span of multiple generations-each new generation hears tales of beautiful flying serpents made of stars and considers it a great blessing to see this creature once more. Only on rare occasions does a mix couatl abandon a settlement. This usually happens when the mix couatl recognizes that its attempts to improve the settlement may actually be harmful, whether due to a potential loss of important traditions or when the possibility of growth could expose the settlement to great dangers from the outside world.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Tyrants_Grasp.jpg","_id":"RW6Gy8dWGakp0KPt"}

While in this form, the moss golem's reach increases to 30 feet, it gains a 30-foot climb speed, and its DR becomes 15/slashing and adamantine. A moss golem in this form can also move through any crack or hole in a wall or door, no matter how small, without impeding its movement.

Reverting to its normal form is a free action.  </p><p><strong>Immunity to Magic (Ex)</strong> A moss golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against a moss golem, as noted below.  • A <i>diminish plants</i> spell cast on the moss golem causes it to lose its quickness ability for 1d6 rounds.  • A <i>plant growth</i> spell restores 1d6 points of damage per level of the caster (maximum 10d6) to the moss golem.  • Hitting a moss golem in its climbing form with any spell of 6th level or higher with the acid descriptor causes the moss golem to take 10d6 points of acid damage (no save) and lose the use of its climbing form ability for 24 hours.  </p><p><strong>Quickness (Ex)</strong> A moss golem is incredibly quick. It can take an extra move action during its turn each round. This means it can move up to its speed and still make a full attack.</p></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Tyrants_Grasp.jpg","_id":"S99D2BDdp1SRK3ci"}

Each creature within 30 feet of the daemon must succeed at a DC 22 Will save or be affected by <i>crushing despair</i> for as long as it remains within the aura. Creatures that fail their save remain affected by the aura for 1d4+1 rounds after leaving the radius. The anisydaemon gains Fast Healing 5 for as long as at least one creature is affected by its aura. Additionally, creatures that fail their save cannot sleep or receive any benefits of rest while under the effects of the aura. An anisydaemon can activate or deactivate this ability as a free action. The save DC is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Devour Soul (Ex)</strong> Any creature that dies while affected by one of the anisydaemon's mind-affecting abilities-including its aura of worry-has its soul devoured by the fiend's second mouth. That creature cannot be resurrected by any effect short of <i>miracle</i>, <i>wish</i>, or direct intervention from a deity while the anisydaemon lives. Creatures whose souls have been devoured by an anisydaemon can be resurrected normally if the anisydaemon is slain.  </p><p><strong>Hide in Plain Sight (Ex)</strong> An anisydaemon can use the Stealth skill even while being observed. As long as it's standing in an area of at least dim light or shadow, an anisydaemon can hide itself from view without actually hiding behind anything. This ability has no effect if the anisydaemon is not in an area of at least dim light or in an area of shadow of at least Medium size.  </p><p><strong>Shadow Possession (Ex)</strong> As a standard action that provokes an attack of opportunity if the target is aware of the daemon, an anisydaemon can enter the shadow of any creature to which it is currently adjacent. While within a shadow, the anisydaemon is considered to be sharing its target's space, though while the daemon is within a shadow, neither creature takes any penalties from squeezing. The anisydaemon can still affect creatures within 30 feet of itself with its aura of worry, though the daemon can target only the shadow's owner with its psychic magic or spell-like abilities. While within a shadow, an anisydaemon is considered incorporeal and takes half damage from spells and magic weapons. <i>Ghost touch</i> weapons affect it normally. An anisydaemon that dies while possessing a creature's shadow is immediately ejected to a random empty space adjacent to the creature. An anisydaemon can leave a shadow it is possessing as a move action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. If it does so, it is ejected into a free space of its choice adjacent to the creature whose shadow it was possessing. When an anisydaemon is possessing a creature's shadow, that creature cannot benefit from morale bonuses of any kind. An anisydaemon can use its Stealth skill to hide while within a shadow.  </p><p><strong>Sunlight Weakness (Ex)</strong> An anisydaemon exposed to  natural sunlight is unable to use any of its psychic magic or spell-like abilities and cannot project its aura of worry. An anisydaemon possessing a creature's shadow does not count as being in direct sunlight, even if the creature whose shadow it's possessing is.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Anisydaemons, or \"worry daemons,\" represent death by stress and anxiety. Their work can be seen in the artisan who drives herself to death because she fears her work will never be good enough, or through the husband making himself sick wondering if his partner secretly has a lover and analyzing every detail of every interaction until his mind can no longer take the strain.  Anisydaemons average around 14 feet tall and weigh about 1 ton. Occasionally, some anisydaemons reach truly monstrous sizes after coaxing countless victims to their deaths. These fiends often grow additional mouths on other parts of their bodies, such as their hands or torsos, which magnify the power of their psychic whispers. Despite their bulk, those attempting to escape an anisydaemon discover the fiends can squeeze into impossibly small spaces in pursuit.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p> Anisydaemons are most often found in slave cities in Abaddon, stalking the mortal populace and keeping their minds too worn down to foster hope and too distracted by the problems their own minds produce to consider rebellion. However, they sometimes take sabbaticals on the Material Plane to find fresh souls to torment and devour.  The fiends have smooth, hairless, almost rubbery black skin. They're bipedal, with arms and legs that end in claws as sharp as a surgeon's blade. But by far, their most disturbing feature is their eyeless faces adorned with two wide maws. From the top maw comes a constant susurrus of whispers that seems to access any listeners' deepest worries and insecurities, while the bottom mouth waits to snatch the souls of the creature's victims.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  While they originate in Abaddon and are most often found there, anisydaemons can be found in any location with large amounts of people. They typically do their work alone, and they see others of their kind or of a comparable strength more as rivals for the same resources than as allies. Anisydaemons have been known to work in groups of up to seven of their own kind, but only when commanded to do so by a summoner or a daemon even more powerful than the group of them together.  Anisydaemons can be found working in the interests of any of the Horsemen. For the Horseman of War, they often help drive up  levels of anxiety and paranoia between different groups, eventually culminating in each group believing that their best hope for survival is to eliminate the others. For the Horseman of Famine, anisydaemons often target the wealthy in times of scarcity and press upon their worries of starvation, leading them to hoard what little food is available and allowing countless poor to starve. The Horseman of Pestilence uses these daemons during outbreaks of sickness to convince the healthy their only hope of survival is to eliminate the sick, as such violence often ends up helping sickness spread anyway.

It can also move without harm or impediment through bogs, thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that are magically manipulated to impede motion.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Hidden away in deep caverns or under the shade of mangroves in isolated swamps, sump stewards hum songs while they dutifully tend to verdant colonies of  mushrooms and fungi. Vaguely humanoid in form, sump stewards carry old tree trunks, rotting logs, or other large tools to help them tend and protect these colonies while they make their rounds. As they work, they sing low, thrumming tunes that echo throughout their domain.  Sump stewards-who, despite their intelligence, have no name for themselves and only indifferently acknowledge the names given by other races-have long, spindly limbs that possess great strength. Their form consists of mosses and lichens, with vines wrapping their bodies and holding them together. Mushrooms sprout all over the sump steward's form, although two red mushrooms glow where eyes would be. Some sump stewards grow long beards made of interwoven moss or grass.  A sump steward stands almost 15 feet tall, though they are frequently hunched over and seem shorter. They weigh approximately 1,400 pounds.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p> Sump stewards begin life as a pair of red mushrooms. These rare mushrooms often grow in fungal colonies tended by older sump stewards, who keep the new sump stewards sheltered and well-fed. Any creatures that invade the colony are quickly and firmly escorted away by the attendant sump stewards. By the time the red mushrooms are ready to sprout, an attendant sump steward has usually prepared a pile of twigs, leaves, moss, and other organic debris nearby. When the mushrooms sprout, they send shoots out to wrap around the offerings and form a body; the original red mushrooms serve as the new sump steward's eyes. Sump stewards that grow unattended form bodies from whatever debris is near and might seem mismatched as a result: some of these unattended sump stewards might walk with a limp, bear additional limbs, or have forms that incorporate bones or rocks.  While sump stewards' bodies can look rather hodgepodge, they are resilient and strong. The vines that wrap their bodies regrow quickly and knit a sump steward back together with remarkable speed. While not inherently violent, sump stewards don't hesitate to use their strength to protect their domain, encouraging local plants to restrain and delay intruders. If lethal force is required, they can use their oversized farming implements as greatclubs and expel clouds of poisonous spores that functions as the <i>cloudkill</i> spell. Goblins and other underground races tend to avoid sump steward colonies, venturing into them only under dire circumstances.  Arcano-botanists posit that all sump stewards are biological duplicates of one original organism, spreading asexually via their spores for thousands or millions of years all across Golarion. It is unknown how long an individual sump steward lives, but an elven explorer reported meeting the same sump steward 800 years apart.   It's even possible that the original sump steward is still alive, tending to some remote colony to this day.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Sump stewards are social creatures; a group of sump stewards is called a choir because they sing together. Every sump steward in a choir sings its own unique song, and when the voices come together, the subtly different melodies build upon one another in a haunting music that echoes throughout their domain. Sump stewards' social structures are intensely hierarchical. The eldest in a choir speaks for-and makes binding decisions for- every sump steward in the choir.  Sump stewards live primarily underground or deep in primeval forests and swamps, although they can be found anywhere they can manage to grow their colonies. While a single sump steward might tend to a relatively small colony, a choir of sump stewards might have a domain that encompasses many square miles. These fungal forests have their own unique ecology: various slimes, jellies, and oozes make their home among the stalks of giant mushrooms, while large packs of fungal crawlers (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2</i> 127) scamper along the floor. Giant slugs sometimes live within a colony, as they are attracted to and pacified by sump steward songs.  Sump stewards have a longstanding but puzzling rivalry with treants. Entire choirs have been observed to travel far from their colonies to attack a treant grove, leaving their treasures and young sump stewards unguarded as they wage these attacks. Treants don't share this violent animosity, but they think poorly of sump stewards, likening them to parasites or blights on nature. The source of this intense enmity isn't clear; sump stewards and treants rarely inhabit the same areas, so they don't typically compete for resources. Sump stewards don't take much stock in what other creatures think of them, so it's unlikely that treants' dismissive attitude toward sump stewards is sufficient to generate this ire. Whatever the reason, sump stewards and treants never cooperate, and they usually come to blows if they encounter one another.  <br /><strong>NOTABLE SUMP STEWARDS</strong><br />  Sump stewards exist across Golarion, including the following locations.  <br /><strong>Kaer Maga:</strong> One of the most notable colonies of sump stewards is located under Kaer Maga, in the  deep and mysterious chasm called Nursery Trench. This chasm is so choked with fungal growth that it is nearly impassable, although the form of an overgrown cathedral is barely visible at the chasm's lowest point. The choir of sump stewards in Nursery Trench is headed by a steward called Calando Mosswort. It's said that the cathedral Calando's choir guards holds secrets from before Earthfall.  <br /><strong>Mindspin Mountains:</strong> A sump steward known as Lichenback leads a choir in eastern Varisia. Dwarven traders occasionally pass through Lichenback's large colony in the Mindspin Mountains. Lichenback lets travelers pass if they give up a token, which the sump steward adds to an impressive collection of mementos in a collapsed tower choked with fungus.  <br /><strong>Fangwood:</strong> Fluge Darkwood leads an exceptionally large choir in the Fangwood Forest, near the strange blight that pervades the forest's heart. It's unknown if Fluge's choir has been corrupted by Arlantia, or if they simply find the blight more hospitable for rampant fungal growth. Rumors persist that the sump stewards' songs echoing through the Fangwood are paeans to the horrid god Cyth-V'sug.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Tyrants_Grasp.jpg","_id":"Xowmp8JGRANZ0aB2"}

An abandoned armory begins combat in ebb-tide mode (reflected in the above statistics). In rip-tide mode, an abandoned armory undergoes several changes, as noted below.  • The abandoned armory's AC decreases from 29 to 24.  • The abandoned armory's speed increases from 20 to 50 feet.  • The abandoned armory applies twice its Strength modifier to its slam attacks and threatens a critical hit on a roll of 18-20.  • The abandoned armory's reach increases from 15 to 25 feet.  • The abandoned armory gains the trip ability with its slam attacks.  • The abandoned armory loses its leaden weariness, perimeter defense, and reflect spells abilities.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>An abandoned armory is an animated mass of weapons and armor, both magic and mundane, as well as spell-imbued items of offensive utility. Moving with uncanny locomotion, these constructs scour battlefields seeking objects of war that once held special significance to previous owners who were slain in combat. Due to the faint psychic imprints of the slain combatants from which they collect these artifacts, abandoned armories make it their mission to reunite the items with their past owners or find new owners worthy of wielding their finds. This process proves to be fatal, however, as the constant psychic echoes cause an abandoned armory to believe everyone is unworthy and slay them in hopes of finding a new suitable owner for that individual's equipment. This behavior has led abandoned armories to become something to be feared on the battlefield as they tear through an area, slaying every combatant they encounter.  An abandoned armory is roughly 15 feet wide, cresting up to 20 feet tall, and weighs about 15 tons.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p> Abandoned armories are rare, as their creation requires an unlikely confluence of environmental conditions and historical circumstances, along with a fair bit of luck. Across Golarion, only a handful of battlefields and other sites of mass death and suffering contain sufficient psychic echoes of terror and pain, as well as buried or hidden implements of war-magic weapons, armor, and other trinkets-to give rise to an abandoned armory. In addition to the psychic imprints that serve as the foundation for the constructs, the genesis of abandoned armories hinges on the application of additional, formidable arcane or divine power, often as an unintended consequence of unrelated events. A leaking seal on a long-forgotten eldritch prison, a thinning of the veil between planes, or a potent ritual to summon a demon may provide the energy needed for an abandoned armory to lurch into animation. When the psychic imprints and magical energy mix at a perfect balance, it can form a small abandoned armory. Once  animated, the abandoned armory is quick to grow into the massive terror that is the bane of all battlefields.  The magic binding that binds armories together does eventually fade away, causing the constructs' various collected items to become open for the taking. These mounds of equipment, typically overgrown with vegetation and hidden by the passage of years, contain treasure troves of items that are prized by fortune hunters. The process for an abandoned armory's collapse usually happens in one of two ways. The more common method is through the destruction of the construct. This usually damages many of the constituent items and makes the process of salvaging this equipment tedious at best. On the other hand, abandoned armories naturally collapse and dissipate when the magic that fuels them is exhausted. This usually happens to \"longer-lived\" abandoned armories that consume the innate magical energies after countless battles. The energy required to activate an abandoned armory's various abilities slowly saps these magical energies until the abandoned armory lacks enough energy to maintain its form.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  The abandoned armory is solitary, lacking the intelligence or empathy required to create bonds with other entities. No one claims to know what would happen if two or more abandoned armories happened to meet on some devastated ancient battlefield. Perhaps the constructs would sense an alignment of purpose, and fuse together to create a larger, even more formidable tide of metal destruction. Alternatively, the abandoned armories might simply clash mindlessly against one another until their constituent metal melted to slag and their magic power was spent.  Certain creatures have taken an interest in abandoned armories, almost to the extent of representing a symbiotic relationship. Scavenging tribes of goblins who forage at the edges of legendary battlefields have developed a near-religious awe of the constructs, and they regard the appearance of an abandoned armory both as a good omen and a prime opportunity to comb the destruction left by its passage for interesting new tools and trinkets. To attract an abandoned armory, the goblins erect crude fetishes at the edges of their territory, making offerings of assorted \"magic\" items in the hope of  drawing the attention of the construct. The rare occasions when an abandoned armory does indeed appear are just as likely to result in the hopeful goblins being destroyed by a tide of unstoppable metal and magic as they are to fulfill the goblins' greed for treasure.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Tyrants_Grasp.jpg","_id":"apx4cJtaXNiXLu7y"}

When a pallid angel kills a creature using a manufactured melee weapon,  she can splash its blood (or similar remains) on herself as a free action, even if it's not her turn.

The pallid angel regains a number of hit points equal to the greatest amount of healing or damage a targeted creature would receive, and no other creatures are affected by the effect. A pallid angel can consume energy this way three times per day.  </p><p><strong>Profane Ward (Su)</strong> A pallid angel's spell resistance is increased by 5 against spells with the good descriptor and spells cast by worshippers of good-aligned deities.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Urgathoa is known best as a goddess of plague and undeath, yet the Pallid Princess has wider interests than the uninitiated might assume. Pallid angels, created by Urgathoa from the souls of her most dedicated champions and priestesses, represent these interests. Warriors and tacticians, wielders of profane magic and cruel weaponry, pallid angels are embodiments of the goddess's appetite for wanton bloodshed and forbidden pleasures.  The ave<i>rage</i> pallid angel stands 7 feet tall and weighs 200 pounds.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p> Created by Urgathoa as mockeries of true angels, pallid angels strongly resemble the celestial beings for which they were named, and if <i>cleanse</i>d of the stains of their hedonism they can often pass for such goodly creatures. Pallid angels particularly enjoy such deceptions, taking advantage of gullible mortals to revel in their adulation and spread the indulgent ways of the Pallid Princess. However, unlike true angels, pallid angels are universally female, with bodies resembling those they had or most desired in life.  As outsiders, pallid angels have no need to eat or sleep; however, befitting their nature as favored servants of the goddess of indulgence, they seek out and revel in the pleasures of the flesh. Though any act of carnal pleasure is of interest to them, great feasts both mundane and cannibalistic, sexual excesses, and intoxicants of every variety are common pursuits for pallid angels. Most pallid angels also blend their hedonism with enjoyment of milder sensual delights such as massages, luxurious comforts and furnishings, and even long periods of indolent slumber, for less intense acts make the greater pleasures all the more ecstatic by comparison.  In addition to their hedonistic urges, pallid angels' love of violence and bloodshed drives them to brutally abuse, and often eventually slay, any innocent unfortunate enough to fall into their grasp. Pallid angels take great pleasure in tormenting hostages and prisoners of war, and they occasionally spare unconscious foes for this purpose. A pallid angel denied such victims eventually sates her violent urges upon her companions and servants.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  If the daughters of Urgathoa (<i>Pathfinder Campaign Setting</i>: <i>The Inner Sea World Guide</i> 309) are the goddess's most favored servants in life and unlife, pallid angels are her most favored in what comes after both. Pallid angels are created by Urgathoa from the souls of her greatest female worshippers, given bodies capable of enjoying all the pleasures of the flesh as reward for their service. In Urgathoa's domain on Abaddon, pallid angels spend much of their time indulging their desires, though most also serve as governors, arbiters, and vicious defenders against psychopomp raids.  Pallid angels are often sent in response to <i>planar ally</i> spells or called by <i>planar binding</i> spells; a wise caller is ready to satisfy the angel's hedonism, such as by casting <i>heroes' feast</i> for the angel's exclusive benefit. Pallid angels are often conjured to serve as generals of great armies, particularly those heavy with undeath. Several pallid angels served the Whispering Tyrant as commanders in his initial conquest of Ustalav; at least one remains somewhere in the mountains of Virlych, magically entrapped by Arazni before her death at the Tyrant's hands.  In addition to the angels' role as military leaders, small cults or lone priests might call upon a pallid angel to defend their sanctum from invaders or aid an assault against the forces of good, while hedonistic cults or worshippers occasionally conjure pallid angels simply to share in their pleasures. Urgathoa sometimes sends pallid angels to such pleasure cults unbidden, especially if such a cult has not yet descended fully into evil; the pallid angel serves as a guide to even more perverse indulgences and ensures the cult's corruption to Urgathoa's service.  Pallid angels and daughters of Urgathoa both hold great authority and honor among the faithful of the Pallid Princess, and many of those who eventually became pallid angels were first elevated to be daughters of Urgathoa upon their mortal deaths. When brought together, pallid angels serve as a martial counterpart to the more ecclesiastical role played by daughters, much like the paladins and clerics of good faiths. In such cases, pallid angels and daughters cooperate in service to the goddess's will, though their relationship is often strained. Pallid angels often treat daughters with subtle pity and condescension for their reduced access to physical pleasures and their less direct relationship to Urgathoa, while daughters frequently hold angels in quiet contempt for their status as living-and thus less perfect-beings.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Tyrants_Grasp.jpg","_id":"c1v2vuaeGHaoOD4z"}

Despite their undead appearance, these trees are actually alive, growing in the shape of weeping willows to symbolize the loss associated with the deaths that created them. Stray soul fragments remain in a bonewrought willow, giving it a dim intelligence and a keen awareness of living and undead creatures in its vicinity. Bonewrought willows serve as protectors of the dead. They often distrust the living and shake their rattling branches to scare such creatures away. When pressed into combat, a bonewrought willow usually starts by disgorging a spray of partially digested bone fragments at its enemies and then follows up with slam attacks.  A bonewrought willow stands between 12 and 15 feet tall and weighs about 800 pounds.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p> Bonewrought willows originated centuries ago in the Boneyard as skeletal echoes of Material Plane willows. Psychopomps discovered these willows and carefully tended them, appreciating the trees' deep respect for the dead. The spiritual remains contained within these first trees found fertile ground in the Boneyard, allowing for new bonewrought willows to grow on their own. Today, entire copses of the trees thrive in the Boneyard, particularly in the region known as the Graveyard of Souls. Bonewrought willows produce tiny seeds that can drift for many years; a rare few of these blow through portals to other worlds and sprout near large concentrations of bones.  Despite their bony appearance, bonewrought willows are living plants. They share many traits with undead creatures, due to their close association with the dead of the Boneyard, but they require sustenance to survive. Bonewrought willows do not draw nutrients from the soil through their roots; their rootlike appendages are actually phalanges that provide them with surprising mobility. Instead, they gain sustenance by absorbing bone matter. A bonewrought willow requires bones equivalent in size to a human skeleton each month; failure to meet this dietary minimum robs a bonewrought willow of its spray of splintered bones ability, and several months of nutritional deprivation causes the tree to starve to death. Hungry trees range far in search of bones to consume and might become desperate enough to hunt prey.  Bonewrought willows also need light, but not necessarily sunlight, to survive; the moon that looms over the Boneyard is sufficient for their needs. Willows in perpetual shadow sag noticeably, their bark becoming brittle and their fronds sweeping listlessly along the ground. These light-starved bonewrought willows might  shamble toward a bright light source, which can be an unpleasant surprise for a traveler carrying illumination.  Bonewrought willows typically require 15 years to reach full size. During this time, the willows move erratically, if at all, and die if not planted where many bones are within easy reach. As they consume bones, bonewrought willows also acquire faint psychic impressions of the souls echoing in those bones; over many years, these impressions coalesce into a gestalt personality reflective of the willow's meals. A bonewrought willow grown in a corpse-strewn battlefield might be particularly aggressive, while one grown in a monastery's ossuary might be introspective.  Although they protect caches of dead bodies to secure their food sources, bonewrought willows also instinctively protect spirits of the dead. Ghosts and other lost souls can find comfort and shelter beneath the willow's bony fronds, as the tree turns other creatures away from its spectral charges. When they grow in other planes, bonewrought willows extend their sheltering protection to creatures other than spirits. On Golarion, the willows harbor animals of every kind, and it's not uncommon to find birds' nests among the willows' bony branches or arboreal animals lairing in a bony bole.  Bonewrought willows live for multiple centuries. Older willows are distinguishable from younger specimens by the yellowing bones in the branches, although the bones at the tips of branches remain in the best condition regardless of the willow's age.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Bonewrought willows primarily grow in the Boneyard, where they protect souls awaiting a final planar assignment. Many psychopomps cultivate these willows as a hobby or as a way to free up their time to attend to other business without leaving vulnerable souls unprotected. Some psychopomps teach their bonewrought willows specific frond movements to indicate agreement, pleasure, or alarm. Far cleverer than many other plant creatures, the willows often extrapolate these movements to an entire sign language, and they have been seen teaching this language to other bonewrought willows.  Many souls wandering the Boneyard have not yet accepted their fate among the dead. These souls frequently see bonewrought willows as safe and comfortable places to stop and rest, even mistaking them to be ordinary willow trees despite their macabre appearance. Often, this sheltered respite is sufficient for a reluctant soul to realize its condition and come to terms with its recent demise.  Clever or persuasive undead creatures sometimes trick bonewrought willows into acting as bodyguards.  Although the trees have an instinctive desire to protect dead creatures from the living, they eventually abandon a ward that continually places them in danger. Particularly mistreated willows might turn on their charges entirely.  Because they retain echoes of different souls from the bones they consume, bonewrought willows can be targets of spells that seek a corpse's knowledge such as <i>speak with dead</i>. Although a bonewrought willow's responses are often more fragmented than normal for such a spell, it responds to questions in a deep, hollow voice. Bonewrought willows do not speak except when responding to spells.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Tyrants_Grasp.jpg","_id":"epPZnvIXQOaQzBDQ"}

They are particularly known for traveling around the oceans of Golarion to help sailors and other travelers lost at sea. Many sailors claim that they owe their lives to an auwaz couatl, though these same sailors warn that living a particularly vile life will instead draw an auwaz couatl's ire. An auwaz couatl often prefers that evil beings remain lost, and it actively works to ensure such creatures remain lost for as long as possible. A typical auwaz couatl is 8 feet long with a wingspan of 12 feet, and weighs 800 pounds.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p> Auwaz couatls are the most commonly known couatls across Golarion, at least among those people who live near coasts. An auwaz couatl's scales are a light gray with subtle light blue and green markings. Their feathers are typically blue and green, with hints of light yellow reminiscent of the sun. The coloring resembles the waters of the oceans, and the exact coloring of an auwaz couatl tends to vary depending on which body of water the couatl frequents-each major sea and ocean seems to have its own distinct auwaz markings and colorations. The sound of an auwaz couatl's wings resembles that of a gentle ocean breeze. This makes it hard to <i>detect</i> their approach, and many sailors tend to utter short blessings whenever they encounter a calm, compliant breeze, just in case an auwaz couatl is nearby.  Each auwaz couatl knows the location of every settlement on the edge of its waters and is happy to share this knowledge with those it views favorably. Those who draw an auwaz couatl's suspicion sometimes receive inaccurate knowledge, ending up at a settlement a few hundred miles away from their intended destination. An auwaz couatl usually gives this misinformation to allow it time to follow the travelers and determine whether they are dangerous, correcting its original directions only if the travelers appear to be good-hearted. When dealing with evil travelers, an auwaz couatl usually points them toward subtle dangers such as troubled waters, reefs, and other oceanic dangers. The creature won't follow these travelers and is content with letting the ocean determine their fates.  Auwaz couatls have moderate control over the weather, calling forth winds and storms as they feel necessary. They use this power to aid the travel of those they are guiding home, summoning strong winds to make the  journeys of sailing ships shorter. Similarly, if an auwaz couatl encounters a sinking ship, it uses its powers to grant survivors the ability to breathe water and personally guides these victims to safety. This power also allows an auwaz couatl to work against evil travelers, making their journeys difficult and even calling on lightning storms to strike ships when necessary.  Auwaz couatls have the shortest lives of all couatls, living only about a century at most, and most have life spans equivalent to those of humans. Due to their flighty nature, they rarely take the time to meet with others of their kind, though they do gather once every few years to reproduce, laying several eggs each. Its uncertain how auwaz couatls know the exact time to gather, though many believe they read a message in the stars left behind by their cousins, the mix couatls (see page 84).  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Auwaz couatls live roving, independent lives that allow them to travel all across Golarion. Although most auwaz couatls live near the seas and oceans of Golarion, some prefer to stay inland and help those lost in forests or mountains. An auwaz couatl typically sticks to its home in its younger years, but it eventually travels the world through its adult life before returning. Auwaz couatls tend to avoid each other and keep out of each other's affairs, except in times of peril. In these cases, an auwaz couatl uses a particular call, perceptible only to other couatls, to warn of danger. During these fraught times, auwaz couatls travel in packs, especially to protect the younger members of their kind.  As they are generally good-natured and curious, many auwaz couatls take time to speak with any travelers they find, often flying above ships and conversing with those on board. These conversations usually involve current events, as auwaz couatls prefer to keep updated so as to not send travelers to dangerous locales, but they can also include artistic and philosophical discussions. Some auwaz couatls are quite fond of humorous stories and like to spend hours telling such tales, especially if there are children among the travelers. The sight of an auwaz couatl above a ship serves as a signal to others that the ship is protected, so many ships fly kites in the shape of auwaz couatls in hopes of giving marauders pause.  Auwaz couatls are particularly fond of children, as they find kinship in their innocence.  They are more than happy to comfort distressed children and guide them home. In particularly dire situations, or ones where a child may be too far from home to safely travel, an auwaz couatl will carry the child on its back and fly it to safety. An auwaz couatl typically has a different approach with children who have run away from home; the auwaz couatl takes time to speak with the child and learn her reasons for running away. In some cases, the child seeks to escape a troubled life and the auwaz couatl helps guide the child to a new home. In other cases, the auwaz couatl convinces the child to return home but encourages her to cultivate the wanderlust in her heart. Such children tend to grow into adventurers and travel the world years later.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Tyrants_Grasp.jpg","_id":"hI7QheuswQA7yGs6"}

When pest drakes gather, however, they become much more dangerous. The little wyvern-like dragons erode the stone where they nest and grow territorial in large groups, becoming deadly, acid-spitting flocks when agitated.  Some of the smallest dragons, adult pest drakes are just under a foot in length and weigh 1-2 pounds. They live approximately 10-15 years.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p> Centuries ago, a wizard who was jealous of his colleague's bond with a pseudodragon captured a clutch of pseudodragons, determined to create his own draconic familiar. He drained his family's fortune in countless experiments to create a less intelligent and more obedient dragon. His experiments routinely failed, with many of the resulting offspring unable to properly bond as familiars or so frail they died within days of hatching. Decades later, a young paladin of Apsu discovered the wizard's atrocities against dragonkind and confronted the wizard. The wizard's daughter, who had cared for the failed experiments all of her life, released them from their cages, attempting to spare them from her father's magic and the paladin's ire.  Not long after the paladin left the wizard's mansion, the drakes returned to their pen. The daughter, intending to grant them freedom, released them further and further away from her home, only to discover them back in her courtyard each time she returned. Unable to \"free\" the drakes, she instead created a messenger service with them in an attempt to recover her family's fortune. Her plan did not work quite as intended. The drakes became a decades-long fashion fad that spread like wildfire across Golarion's nobility, especially after it was discovered that the creatures could be easily bred to exhibit a variety of colors, spikes, and frill styles. By the time the drakes fell out of fashion, they had become too embedded in their urban homes to ever be fully removed.  Unlike their draconic cousins, pest drakes are highly fertile and mature quickly. Mated pairs lay clutches of two to three eggs each year in the spring and fall. The eggs incubate for 2 months, and a hatchling reaches physical and sexual maturity within 5 months. A mated pair of pest drakes remains together while incubating eggs and raising the hatchlings, but they often find new mates within the flock after those young mature. Each adult in the flock takes at least some role in a hatchling's growth,  often teaching it which places to frequent for food and which to avoid due to danger. Some smaller flocks have been known to follow people who feed them, even as those people age and move to different homes within the city, passing the tribal knowledge of previous kindness from one generation of pest drakes to the next.  Pest drakes are not as vicious as their drake cousins, and they rarely attack creatures larger than themselves. They are omnivorous, subsisting primarily on berries, seeds, insects, and small rodents, though those that inhabit cities get the majority of their diet from scraps dropped by the city's inhabitants. Many pest drakes perch patiently in parks where citizens are likely to rest and eat, waiting for a dropped scrap or the opportunity to steal an untended meal. Some pest drakes have learned that chirping, dancing, and other displays often delight the local populace, leading to the drakes getting more scraps of food.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Pest drakes are social, communal creatures that exist almost entirely within cities. Flocks within cities tend to claim sections of the city as their territories and defend these territories from outside menaces, whether those menaces are other flocks of pest drakes, an invasion of stowaway rats on the docks, or new construction in the nobles' district that disrupts their nests. Flocks of pest drakes found outside of cities still frequently gravitate toward humanoid settlements, latching onto tribes or villages. Pest drakes communicate with each other through a mixture of body language, chirps, clicks, and whistles. They can understand basic words and simple commands in the languages of the humanoids around them, but they lack the ability to fully understand or speak a language.  Masons despise pest drakes. The drakes' acidic biology eventually permeates their roosting places, slowly eating away at the structure beneath. Their acid erodes details on statues, inscriptions on walls, and designs on column capitals. Buildings and statuary made of marble or painted in lighter colors are particularly susceptible to this corrosion, as it slowly darkens the stone and dissolves the paint. Once established, these pests have proven difficult to remove, as they are often too numerous and too prolific to fully exterminate, especially when the local populace so regularly feeds the friendly creatures. In poorer areas where vermin are more prevalent, the citizens often encourage  the habitation of pest drakes to help keep the populations of other pests down.  Many minor nobles still collect and breed pest drakes for racing stock due to their innate ability to always find their way home. Some pest drakes are bred for speed, others for endurance. These races are collectively referred to as \"Rainbow Races\" due to the bright streaks of color that fill the sky when the pest drakes are released. Owners keep racing drakes in housing that limits the drakes' ability to form a bond with others of their kind. Current Rainbow Races have regulations limiting how many pest drakes can be raced at the same time after the Great Drake Disaster in Taldor, in which thousands of half-starved pest drakes were released for a race and subsequently bonded into a flock that decimated the nearby farmland.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Tyrants_Grasp.jpg","_id":"hdFBMlAcr37Fz6XY"}

Wights spawned by a lifeleecher mortic have penalties like true wight spawn, and they are under the command of the mortic who created them for a period of 24 hours, after which they collapse to the ground, devoid of any animating power, and become mundane corpses. These spawn do not have any of the abilities they had in life.  </p><p><strong>Leech Life (Su)</strong> Three times per day as an immediate action after a successful bite attack, a lifeleecher mortic  can siphon a portion of its target's life energy into itself. This functions as the energy drain universal monster rule. If the mortic drains a level in this way, the mortic gains the benefits of a <i>haste</i> spell (CL 8th).  </p><p><strong>Mortic Ferocity (Su)</strong> A lifeleecher mortic has ferocity, as the universal monster rule. However, when the lifeleecher mortic falls below 0 hit points, it does not lose any hit points per round and it is not staggered. A lifeleecher mortic still dies when it reaches a negative number of hit points equal to its Constitution score. Lifeleecher mortics fighting in this state are driven by instinct and default to attacking with their natural weapons, bolstered by their leech life and <i>death knell</i> abilities. Using manufactured weapons or using any other tactics or abilities requires the lifeleecher mortic to succeed at a DC 17 Will saving throw to suppress its instincts.  </p><p><strong>Resurrection Vulnerability (Su)</strong> A <i>raise dead</i> or similar spell cast on a lifeleecher mortic staggers it for 1d4 rounds unless the mortic succeeds at a Will save against the caster's saving throw DC for that spell. Using the spell in this way does not require a material component. When staggered due to such an effect, a lifeleecher mortic cannot use its leech life special ability and its mortic ferocity ability is suppressed. If the lifeleecher mortic is reduced to fewer than 0 hit points while affected by a <i>raise dead</i> effect, it immediately gains the staggered condition and loses 1 hit point per round.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Much like some of their orc kin, lifeleecher mortics often cover themselves in ritual scarring, brands, and auspicious tattoos. However, a lifeleecher mortic's skin is an ashen gray color, signaling their flirtation with death. Of all their markings, lifeleecher mortics most celebrate their death scar: the site of a mortal wound that would have felled creatures far more resilient than an orc, yet that failed to slay the lifeleecher mortic, instead unleashing their mortic heritage.  Lifeleecher mortics are roughly 6 feet tall and weigh about 230 pounds.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p> A lifeleecher mortic's elongated nails resemble a raptor's talons, with razor tusks jutting upward from their lower lip, ending just below their lifeless eyes. Lifeleecher mortics are not born with their mortic abilities; rather, these powers manifest upon a mortic's initial brush with death. As the lifeleecher mortic receives what should be a fatal blow, their orc ferocity triggers something deep within that releases their mortic powers.  Upon receiving any killing blow, the lifeleecher's mortic ferocity activates. The mortic enters a feral, furious state that drives them on, allowing them to continue fighting where other humanoids, even orcs, would fall. As they enters this trance, they forgo weapons and other tools, instead ravaging their opponents with natural attacks,  especially their savage, life-leeching maw. The fact that lifeleechers consume their foes' life energy with their maws leads many of them to gravitate toward cannibalism in general, and even those who do not partake of cannibalism tend to prefer their meat fresh and raw.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Lifeleecher mortics enjoy an almost celebrity status in orc settlements, both feared and revered for their strange ability to shrug off death blows. In a society where might makes right, death-defying lifeleecher mortics quickly climb their tribal hierarchies as their ability to defeat their orc cousins proves their strength and worthiness to rule. In other cases, powerful mortics find themselves quickly sold off to large gladiatorial stables in Belkzen and the Lands of the Linnorm Kings or the savage, tusk-lined fighting pits within the Realm of the Mammoth Lords. Many managers enjoy having a lifeleecher mortic champion in these blood-soaked arenas, as the mortics' prolonged fights and supernatural displays both wow and terrify crowds in a gruesome spectacle often talked about for several seasons after the bout itself.  Unfortunately, lifeleechers' penchant for animating those they defeat into wights, even temporarily, stirs many orc superstitions regarding death and magic. Tribes whisper insults depicting the lifeleechers as undead creatures themselves or suggest that they are possessed by fiends. Of course, most orcs would never say such things to a lifeleecher mortic's face; they are far more likely to grovel at the lifeleecher's feet to garner favor from their much stronger kin.  Many soothsayers, shamans, oracles, and witches believe lifeleecher mortics hold the spirits of fallen orc heroes killed before they fulfilled their destiny, and it is this power that drives these nigh-indestructible warriors. When a lifeleecher mortic takes a mate, it prefers others of its kind; however, due to their orc heritage, these mortics can also breed with orcs and humans, and their often-high status gives them plenty of opportunity to do so. A mortic's offspring, whether orc or half-orc, all have potential to manifest as lifeleecher mortics when their racial ferocity triggers. Unfortunately, tribes all too often attempt to <i>haste</i>n this phenomenon, risking the lives of young orcs to spark this heritage, and it is more likely for a young orc with a lifeleecher mortic parent to die than for the child's mortic abilities to be unleashed.  Lifeleecher mortics who live apart from orc settlements fare far worse than their half-orc cousins in similar communities. Something about their  mannerisms, especially their dead eyes, is off-putting to non-orcs. Add to that their proclivity for cannibalism, and lifeleecher mortics find they do not assimilate well outside of gladiatorial pens or spectacle sideshows, and the public quickly drives them out into the wild when they discover the lifeleecher mortic's questionable heritage and unsavory diet. This suits most lifeleecher mortics just fine, as outside of orc lands they gravitate towards loner lifestyles as explorers, big-game hunters, and practitioners of guerrilla warfare.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Tyrants_Grasp.jpg","_id":"nAcqW1rU7HmuA2bS"}

A creature that succeeds at a DC 14 Fortitude save takes half this damage and is dazzled for 1 round. A tooth fairy monarch's scepter is destroyed by this explosion, but its other gear is unaffected. The save DC is Constitution-based.  </p><p><strong>Scepter (Su)</strong> Each tooth fairy monarch owns a heavy scepter of wood, scrap metal, and twine. In the hands of a tooth fairy monarch, the scepter functions as a <i>+1 morningstar</i>. Any loose tooth the tooth fairy monarch touches to the scepter  remains firmly adhered to it, requiring a successful DC 25 Strength check to remove, although a tooth fairy monarch can pluck a tooth from its scepter automatically with its tooth eater ability. The scepter has hardness 10 and 15 hit points. If a tooth fairy monarch's scepter is destroyed, all attached teeth fall free and the tooth fairy monarch is staggered until it can create another one, which requires 1 hour of work and a small amount of junk. Although a scepter can hold dozens of teeth, a tooth fairy monarch usually has only 1d6 teeth attached to its scepter when encountered.  </p><p><strong>Tooth Eater (Su)</strong> Using its sinuous tongue, a tooth fairy monarch can grab and consume an unattached tooth within 5 feet as a move action, so long as the tooth is unattended or in its possession (such as attached to its scepter). The tooth fairy monarch regains a number of hit points equal to its Hit Dice (5 hit points for most tooth fairy monarchs), gains nourishment as though it had eaten a full meal, and recovers the use of one of its expended daily spell-like abilities of its choice (if any).</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>The rare and reclusive leaders of clans of tooth fairies (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 4</i> 262), tooth fairy monarchs rule their smaller, lesser kin with imperious commands and domineering bluster. These monarchs collect the teeth pulled by the lesser tooth fairies as tribute, affixing the teeth to their magical scepters or forming them into simple jewelry such as crowns, bracelets, or necklaces. A monarch can consume these teeth to gain a burst of supernatural nourishment. They find teeth of large, powerful creatures to be tastier than those of children or smaller creatures (such as other tooth fairies), but they will command their tooth fairy minions to offer up their own teeth for consumption as punishment for failure, or simply to remind onlookers of their authority.  In combat, a tooth fairy monarch prefers to hold back behind a screen of tooth fairies, exhorting their minions to attack. Monarchs use their spell-like abilities to distract and debilitate foes while directing their minions to pull their enemies' teeth. Tooth fairies bring these teeth to the monarch, even in the middle of a fight, so the monarch can consume them on the spot or stick them to their scepters for later consumption. Fundamentally cowardly, a tooth fairy monarch encountered on its own usually attempts to flee using lies or magical trickery.  A tooth fairy monarch stands 3 feet high and weighs about 30 pounds.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p> Tooth fairy monarchs claim to know secret rituals to elevate common tooth fairies to their own royal stature. They dangle this possibility in front of their dim-witted subjects to compel adoration and loyalty, but the truth is much simpler than the monarchs would like their minions to   realize: a tooth fairy that consumes an excessive amount of humanoid teeth-several dozen in a single sitting-might enter a magically induced lethargy and fall asleep. While the tooth fairy is sleeping, a cocoon develops around it and, in about a month, the creature emerges as a tooth fairy monarch. To prevent common tooth fairies from learning the true nature of this transformation, monarchs insist that tooth fairies bring them the teeth they collect, which the monarch hoards. If the monarch hears of a strange cocoon forming within a tooth fairy's lair, he insists on having the cocoon incinerated. Not only does this extreme measure prevent a new tooth fairy monarch from emerging; it also serves to silence any suspicions about where the cocoon came from.  Tooth fairy monarchs appear to be large tooth fairies from the waist up, but their lower halves resemble a fleshy beetle or cockroach. The membranous wings protruding from their backs appear comically small, but they are powerful enough to sustain the creature in flight. Tooth fairy monarchs produce paralytic saliva but rarely bite their enemies, as they prefer to remain at a safe distance from foes.  Tooth fairy monarchs might survive for many decades, but the rough and violent life of squabbling tooth fairy clans means few survive more than 20 or 30 years. A tooth fairy monarch that isn't violently overthrown by its own minions, assassinated by a rival monarch, or slain by humanoids grows increasingly fat. While its torso expands, its limbs shrivel, leaving only a ball-shaped head over a quivering mass of flesh. Eventually unable to feed itself, much less defend itself, an old tooth fairy monarch is easy prey for rivals.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  A tooth fairy monarch is rarely encountered without an entourage of several tooth fairies. These attendants serve the monarch diligently, although their attitudes range from genuine respect and adoration to ill-concealed disdain. Outright rebellion against a monarch is rare, however, as tooth fairy monarchs are powerful enough to bully lesser tooth fairies into compliance and frequently punish disloyal minions by removing and consuming all of their teeth in front of them.  Tooth fairy monarchs live in unused basements, abandoned farms, or other isolated locales that are near humanoid settlements but out of the way of  casual observation. Here, tooth fairy monarchs set up their courts, building makeshift throne rooms from scraps discarded by humanoid society. Tooth fairy monarchs often have several minor magic items in their lairs, as many can activate or even create magic items with a casual skill that is the envy of humanoid spellcasters.  Tooth fairy monarchs are willing to stand up to nearly any creature with imperious bluster. The sole exceptions to their bravado are cats.

Chicomes accomplish this by way of powerful druidic magic and the cloud of restorative pollen and dew that constantly drifts from their wings.  Like other couatls, chicomes have varicolored feathers and beautiful, glossy scales. The couatls' wing feathers are typically shades of green or brown, but their crests are always a brilliant crimson. Like for other couatls, the feathers of chicomes are incredibly powerful magic items when bestowed upon chosen mortals. Such a freely given feather can be used as the material component for a <i>planar ally</i> spell (see page 48 of the <i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</i> for more details). In addition, if buried in at least 6 inches of soil and undisturbed for 24 hours, the feather can be used  as the material component to cast a <i>hallow</i> spell; the spell effect tied to the <i>hallow</i>ed site is always the enrichment version of <i>plant growth</i>. By using a chicome feather in this way, the caster need not expend the typical payment of gold or other valuables required by the spell.  A typical chicome is 40 feet long with a wingspan of 30 feet and weighs 5,500 pounds.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p> Chicomes typically show themselves only in the aftermath of an incredible act of devastation or widespread destruction, such as a massive battle or the razing of a large settlement, and even then only if the couatl deems the area in question worthy of being restored. Their exact criteria for worthy lands are unclear; what is known is that badlands chosen by one of these blessed sky serpents are enormously enriched by the outsider's presence. When a chicome restores the balance of nature to a ruined area, it cleanses the land of any residual toxins and contagions, such as contaminated earth or water, and plants the seeds of new life. If the restoration of healthy biomes is not enough to draw nearby wildlife back to the region- or if all the local fauna has been exhausted-the couatl uses its magic to coax animals from other corners of the world to the fledgling environment.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Chicomes are strictly solitary creatures who dwell in the lands that need their help. While they are purifying a particular region, chicomes periodically take flight to survey the area and determine whether their presence is still justified. The couatls also scout for worthy guardians in the vicinity to take over stewardship-typically a powerful <i>awaken</i>ed animal, but sometimes a nemophilist in a nearby settlement. These individuals typically become druids who learn their abilities from the chicome, though anyone the couatl deems worthy may serve as a steward of such lands, regardless of the individual's magical prowess. Those who have received a chicome's blessing are sometimes referred to as Children of the Chicome. If ever one such steward is slain while protecting her pocket of wilderness, her host chicome will return its child to life using its powers of reincarnation. The steward is typically reborn as the animal it most identified with in life.  Though they may serve a range of lawful and good deities, chicomes are typically agents of those gods with an aspect of nature or life, such as Erastil or Cihua Couatl (see page 66), or empyreal lords like Cernunnos or Valani. Some chicomes may even serve neutral-aligned deities such as Gozreh or Feronia. Chicomes never serve deities, no matter how noble, whose portfolio includes the destruction of nature or the spread of civilization, such as Torag. Many chicomes serve no deities at all and are dedicated only to the primordial forces of nature.

This attack inflicts a number of d6 equal to its CR in damage (10d6 for most etiolings). This damage is not negative energy-it manifests in the form of physical wounds and aches from supernatural aging. Creatures immune to magical aging are immune to this damage, as are undead and creatures with the mortic subtype; otherwise, the damage bypasses  all forms of damage reduction. A successful DC 24 Fortitude save halves the damage dealt. An etioling cannot turn this ability off.  </p><p><strong>Ectoplasmic Seep (Su)</strong> An etioling's body constantly weeps ectoplasm-a physical manifestation of the bleachling apathy her body can no longer contain. Any creature touching or being touched by an etioling, or attacking her with a melee weapon, must succeed at a DC 20 Reflex saving throw or be coated in this fluid apathy, taking a -2 penalty on attack rolls, caster level checks, saving throws, skill checks, and weapon damage rolls until the ectoplasm can be scraped off as a standard action. The save DC is Constitution-based.  </p><p><strong>Ectoplasmic Shield (Su)</strong> An etioling adds her Charisma modifier as a deflection bonus to her Armor Class.  </p><p><strong>Ghostly Gasp (Su)</strong> In addition to the normal abilities all mortics gain when using their death gasp, an etioling gains a fly speed of 30 feet (perfect) and can pass through walls and other solid obstructions as if under the effects of <i>ethereal jaunt</i>, except that the etioling cannot pass through living creatures or plants. While moving through a wall or other solid object in this way, the etioling treats the structure as difficult terrain and must use additional movement to pass through it.  </p><p><strong>Spells (Ex)</strong> An etioling casts spells as a 10th-level bard but cannot cast spells while holding her breath.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Perhaps the most miserable of the mortics-humanoids infused with necrotic energy-etiolings are born from gnomes who have already begun to suffer from the Bleaching. The burst of negative energy into their living flesh twists the process and awakens connections to the First World and long-lost fey magic, leaving the surviving creature ethereal, manic, and overflowing with the vital essence of fey. While they resemble bleachling gnomes, veins of primal, First World energy pump beneath an etioling's pale flesh. Occasional pulses of unchecked energy crackle across their flesh and hair.  Their transformation is hardly one of redemption. An etioling's touch decays living flesh to fuel the supernatural furnace that rages inside them, and their bodies shake uncontrollably as the churn of primordial magic and negative energy causes tremors and muscle spasms. Focusing for more than a few moments becomes impossible, and etiolings become creatures of instinct and impulse, acting on vague memories and emotional connections. Like ghosts, they stick for days or weeks into a routine, reliving some pivotal memory and assigning familiar identities to new people they meet. Etiolings suspend not only their living functions but also their physical connection to the living world, becoming ethereal when they hold their breath.  An etioling stands between 2 and 3 feet tall and weighs about 25 pounds.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p> Outwardly, etiolings seem carefree and giddy-almost unsettlingly so-as they struggle to focus or hold still. Their existence is a constant battle of wills between the heady, screaming rush of euphoria provided by their rekindled connection to the First World and any semblance of rational thought. The struggle to maintain themselves can be overwhelming, and those who don't succumb to mania are often aggressive and irritable instead. This supernatural wellspring of emotion forces bleachling apathy from their bodies, manifesting it as a physical ectoplasm capable of turning aside attacks and infecting other creatures.  Like most mortics, etiolings spring forth from disaster. Anywhere negative energy intrudes on the living world- especially in powerful surges-gnomes risk this unnatural transformation. The infusion of necrotic power hijacks the Bleaching that most gnomes succumb to, warping their minds and reigniting ancient connections to sylvan magic. Most mortic gnomes develop unsettling or \"ghostly\" magic focusing on illusions, <i>fear</i>, and <i>confusion</i>, but others develop more primordial and fey magic that hijacks others' emotions and inspires endless revelry.  Whether courtesy of the negative energy replacing their souls or the powerful fey magic that burns inside them, etiolings can briefly slip from the physical world and become ghostly apparitions capable of flight and passing through solid matter. This ethereal state <i>silence</i>s the mania bubbling from within and allows the crushing bleachling depression to flow over them, providing painful respite from their energetic lives. Because this unearthly state severs them from the wellspring of emotion that powers their magic, they cannot use any of their sylvan magic while incorporeal.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Those etiolings who survive their radical change with their minds largely intact often band together in small communities for support. More often, evil and abusive fey flock to the mortic gnomes-attracted by the sylvan magic and primal emotion like flies to honey-and orbit the etioling to bask in the chaos they create or prey on creatures weakened by the dread gnome's deadly caress.  Thanks to their magic and incidental allure to fey, etiolings usually find homes in primeval wildernesses. Even those who take up residence in permanent structures find their magic and unwanted followers transforming any dwelling into an overgrown ruin within weeks. Because they cannot control their corrupting touch, anything the gnomes interact with regularly is scrubbed clean of life, from insects and moss to gardens to mortal neighbors. While the world around them flourishes, their own circles decay into tumbledown sterility.  Storms bring some measure of calm to the etioling's mind-as if the primordial energy within them were siphoned off by the more powerful forces swirling about- and the mortics can seem truly mad as they rejoice in dangerous weathers. Most are simply intoxicated by the terrible but awesome displays of nature, though a few become true servants of powerful weather-controlling outsiders or fey, striking grim bargains to bring suffering to others in exchange for control over their own unstable minds.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Tyrants_Grasp.jpg","_id":"oYDEMOvMXWnEKmrF"}

An affected creature is paralyzed for 1 round unless it succeeds at a DC 13 Fortitude save. Elves are immune to this effect.

Angheuvore mortics, or \"half-ghouls,\" are lanky, pallid creatures with an insatiable hunger for flesh. They have the long ears and featureless, dark eyes characteristic of elves but have a larger jaw filled with sharp teeth. Born from elven parents afflicted with ghoul fever or otherwise subjected to necromantic energies, angheuvores are often shunned as children due to their appetites. They typically grow up on their own or among degenerate communities of other angheuvores. Never fully satisfied without a belly full of humanoid flesh, angheuvores lurk at the edges of civilization looking for opportunities to sate their appetites. Some angheuvores keep other humanoids as prisoners to feast upon at their leisure, and the victims in these \"larders\" live in constant fear of becoming the next meal. Angheuvores living within humanoid communities often keep a low profile by subsisting on corpses and frequently work as gravediggers, morticians, or physicians.  Like elves, angheuvores are long lived, often drifting from community to community for centuries. They share an appreciation for art, although angheuvore aesthetics are often unpleasant to other humanoids, as they predominantly center on the look and smell of blood, flesh, and organs. Unlike elves, angheuvores aren't particularly patient and don't take any particular care to live in harmony with their surroundings.  Angheuvores and ghouls get along reasonably well, and they often share hunting territory or even coexist in the same isolated communities. Angheuvores enjoy the elven immunity to the ghouls' paralyzing toxin, but angheuvores are as susceptible to ghoul fever as any other humanoid, and can become infected via infighting or even by sharing food. An angheuvore who dies from ghoul fever always putrefies and rises as a ghast. These ghasts retain their memories and any class levels acquired by the angheuvore; the transition from living to undead is not as jarring a step for an angheuvore.  Angheuvores are typically 6 feet tall and weigh about 125 pounds.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Tyrants_Grasp.jpg","_id":"pFpdxQGEcclnGnn5"}

The save DC is Constitution-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>The pixie circle is an aggressive invasive species that opportunistically drains energy from nearby plant and  animal life to fuel its teleporting abilities. It uses these abilities to remove potential threats from its habitat, typically teleporting creatures away when it is threatened or hurt. These sturdy vines are resistant to heat, cold, and drought conditions, and an infestation is notoriously difficult to root out once it has taken hold. A mature pixie circle measures 20 feet in diameter and is always in flower regardless of the season.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p> While it shares a passing resemblance to wisteria or honeysuckle, pixie circle behaves like mistletoe and parasitically attaches itself to larger plants and trees while it establishes itself. Smaller infestations do not flower and can be difficult to detect, as the pixie circle tends to blend in with its host foliage. Once the plant is mature enough to put out flowers, it is large enough to attack and teleport victims, and continues to grow at an astonishing rate.  The flowers of a pixie circle resemble the multicolored wings of pixies when seen from a distance, making them a clear signal for people aware of the plant to keep their distance. Its growths can easily dominate large trees and can cover small cottages in a single season. Left unchecked, the plant can overwhelm groves or entire sections of woodlands, burying everything living beneath the pretty green and purple vines and leaving wide patches of dead forest in its wake.  The plant is opportunistic in nature and initially prefers to absorb energy from host trees before progressing to insects, small birds, and eventually the larger animal life that wanders into range. As a result, most humanoids encounter the vine only when it is large enough to be a threat. Because of its growth pattern, a pixie circle tends to form a ring around an open meadow, creating a natural lure for large herbivores and adventurers seeking a safe place to camp. Adventurers with sharp eyes and knowledge of the natural world can recognize these meadows by their odd circular pattern and the unnatural silence within them. The vines of well-established patches typically hide the bones of previous victims, animal and humanoid alike. The belongings of the deceased are often in excellent condition, as scavengers tend to avoid these remains.  Pixie circles spread underground using offshoots strong enough to punch through clay and rocky soils. Solid rock or a brick wall can contain the runners within a garden, but such barriers must extend at least 6 feet belowground. Clippings and small pieces will take root within a week if left in contact with fertile soil. Pixie circles are also self-pollinating, and their seeds are light enough to carry on wind. This makes containment of the plant extremely difficult, as these seeds can cover several miles of distance with a slight breeze.  Once a pixie circle reaches its full size, it secretes a unique toxin from all of its vines. This toxin dries out cells and causes a pixie circle's victims to grow weak, making it difficult for prey to escape. In addition to its predatory applications, this toxin is also laced with arcane energies. Once the toxin is flowing through a victim's veins, the pixie circle can attempt to harness the arcane energy to transport the creature to another pixie circle elsewhere.  Scholars disagree as to the exact details of a pixie circle's teleportation abilities. Some believe that the pixie circle developed these abilities to keep its particular habitat clear of any predators or competition for food. Others claim that this ability allows them to propagate much more easily as a species, as it allows pixie circles to share prey with each other. This becomes especially useful for pixie circles attempting to establish footholds in new territories.  Some adventurers risk intentionally provoking these plants to benefit from their teleportation abilities. Those who have studied pixie circles know that they are more intelligent than they let on. By speaking with a pixie circle, these insightful adventurers can convince it to teleport a target without the need for combat. The pixie circle will send willing targets to another pixie circle of their choice, though this process still requires exposure to a pixie circle's toxin. While painful, this is a somewhat reliable process, and bold druids and rangers make use of it.  Given its rate of growth and tolerance of a wide range of environments, many believe that the pixie circle is not a naturally occurring plant; signs seem to point to an origin associated with fey. Whether it was created through magical experimentation or intentional breeding is unclear, and it remains an open question whether the first pixie circles escaped to the outside world of their own accord or through deliberate release.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Pixie circles grow in nearly any environment, from snowy taiga to humid jungles, so long as there are suitable creatures in the area to serve as prey. The plant is rare in sandy deserts and other barren environments, and underwater and underground growths are unheard of. Regardless of its environment, a pixie circle adopts the appearance and coloration of local flora to better hide.  Although pixie circles are highly invasive and difficult to clear, civilizations do their best to contain or remove these plants when they grow nearby. Several workers can clear a patch of young pixie circles within a few days, but  even the smallest scrap of root or branch left behind can allow them to reestablish themselves, requiring repeated efforts to keep them under control.  In rural Avistani communities, parents warn children to avoid pixie circles should they encounter them, lest the children be stolen away by the fey-a reasonable concern given the plants' ability to teleport victims. Alternatively, some tell stories of a stranger staggering out of the circle speaking a language none in the village recognize or wearing clothes that are hundreds of years out of style. A few lucky survivors return with stories of adventures in the First World or Nithveil.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Tyrants_Grasp.jpg","_id":"psCFLPDjX69eACUA"}

This bleed cannot be stopped while the creature is within the cauldron bloom's stomach. Corpses of creatures slain by this damage are torn apart, as <i>disintegrate</i>. Furthermore, creatures within the stomach must succeed at a DC 23 Reflex save to maintain control while caught in the currents or be nauseated for  1 round; creatures with freedom of movement are still affected but gain a +4 bonus on the saving throw. The save DC is Charisma-based. This otherwise functions as the swallow whole ability, with the following changes: a cauldron bloom can simultaneously hold up to one Gargantuan creature, two Huge creatures, four Large creatures, and so forth; swallowed creatures can use any of their available attacks to cut themselves free; and after a swallowed creature has cut itself free, the cauldron bloom can continue to teleport creatures into its stomach with its warping field ability, but it receives a cumulative -2 penalty to its ability DCs for each time a creature has cut its way out.  </p><p><strong>Terraforming Teleport (Sp)</strong> A cauldron bloom's <i>greater teleport</i> spell-like ability has a range of 1 mile, and the destination must be within enough stone, soil, sand, or similar material to surround the cauldron bloom's body. The material the cauldron bloom will occupy is in turn teleported to backfill the cavity left by the creature's departure. If a cauldron bloom attempts to teleport to an invalid location, the ability fails with no effect.  </p><p><strong>Warping Field (Su)</strong> A cauldron bloom draws prey close with invisible arcane strands, which it projects in one of two forms: diffuse or targeted. Projecting diffuse strands is a swift action, and forces each creature within 120 feet of the cauldron bloom to attempt a DC 23 Reflex save. A creature that fails the save is teleported 60 feet toward the cauldron bloom; if this would bring a creature or object within 30 feet of the cauldron bloom, it is instead teleported into the cauldron bloom's stomach. Projecting targeted strands is a standard action and forces one creature within 360 feet to attempt a DC 23 Fortitude save. If the creature fails, it is teleported into the cauldron bloom's stomach. Targets must be at least one size category smaller than the cauldron bloom, and this ability attempts to teleport the closest creature first. A creature cannot be teleported into the cauldron bloom if it would not fit, as noted above. Creatures affected by effects that block extradimensional travel, such as <i>dimensional lock</i>, are immune to this ability. Both save DCs are Charisma-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Cauldron blooms are immense, slow-moving subterranean plants that maintain their arcane metabolisms by consuming massive quantities of blood. They dwell in cold environs, typically along the migration routes of herd animals, and slowly teleport to new locations in search of food. Feeding cauldron blooms generally erupt from the ground in the midst of such herds. The animals' panicked cries are cut short when the terrified individuals wink out of existence, reappearing a moment later inside the cauldron bloom's otherworldly guts. Arcane winds within the cauldron bloom's stomach rapidly draw the blood from ingested prey, shred their bodies, and leave nothing behind. A particularly hungry cauldron bloom can systematically consume entire herds of animals, or  sequester one individual-such as an unlucky giant or megafauna-inside its stomach. The prey's blood fuels the plant's magical physiology, casting flickering arcane light as it distributes throughout the cauldron bloom's body.  Typically, cauldron blooms live for hundreds of years. Their bodies are around 15 feet in diameter and weigh upward of 80 tons.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p> Cauldron blooms do not feed in a traditional sense. Instead, they wrap potential prey in invisible threads of magical energy. Snared creatures are teleported directly into the blooms' stomachs, where interior winds swirl in a roaring arcane centrifuge that forcibly extracts prey's blood and quickly renders any mundane organic material to a fine powder. Equipment and magical oddities are left behind, however, meaning clouds of manufactured shrapnel circulate within most older cauldron blooms.  Cauldron blooms most often dwell in cold regions. A consistent diet of blood is necessary for them to maintain a healthy and elevated internal temperature. They use their innate teleportation abilities to jump between subterranean points in pursuit of herding prey. Cauldron blooms give little sign of their presence while beneath the ground, and their senses are highly attuned to surface vibrations.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Curiously, despite their warm-blooded nature and massive size, cauldron blooms don't exude heat. This allows them to go largely undetected between feedings. Their petals are also dexterous and quiet enough that their slow burrowing doesn't alert surface-dwellers. Intelligent, meticulous planners, most of these giant plants use their stealth to actively cultivate herds of prey animals. Cauldron blooms may divert water, manage predator populations, and engage in similar protective activities to ensure a long-term food supply.  The plants' unique method of locomotion means their habitats are pocked with  incongruous subsurface materials. A marsh, for instance, may have a stand-alone deposit of dense stone, and a few settlements are even founded on such locations. A dead cauldron bloom, however, may be a hazard to the local environment, as its decay slowly turns the area into a giant sinkhole; a hole above a particularly ancient cauldron bloom eventually reveals a treasure trove of collected objects within the dead creature's gut.  Their heightened intellects mean that cauldron blooms are generally quite knowledgeable about local terrain, fauna, and even historical events, though such information is presented through the unique filter of a subterranean carnivorous plant. One historical record even describes a cauldron bloom with heightened telekinetic abilities working alongside smaller beings to build and protect an entire city; the report's veracity is the subject of ongoing and lively academic debate.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Tyrants_Grasp.jpg","_id":"rrkDRlVQu1soorkh"}

When using this ability, a relictner chooses a structure or manufactured object within 60 feet no larger than 15 feet by 15 feet, such as a statue, treasure chest, or support pillar. The chosen object falls, crumbles, or is otherwise compromised in such a way that it damages any  creature adjacent to it, dealing 12d6 points of damage to each creature, or half as much damage to each creature that succeeds at a DC 21 Reflex save. Alternatively, the relictner can deal only 6d6 points of damage and also attempt a ranged bull rush, trip, or sunder maneuver check as a free action with a +4 racial bonus against each target that fails its Reflex save (sundering in this way deals 6d6 points of damage). This attack may deal more or less damage depending on the object chosen and the GM's discretion, and it typically creates difficult terrain in the area around it. The DC is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Ruin Bond (Su)</strong> A relictner forms a bond with the structure it calls home. Single relictners form bonds with huts or houses, families of relictners bond with castles or temples, and clans can bond with entire ruined cities. All structures in a relictner's bonded ruin lose 1 hit point per day and can be reduced to a minimum of 10 hit points. Within its bonded ruin, a relictner gains a +10 bonus to AC and on saving throws against environmental effects and any traps. A relictner can have only one bonded ruin at a time but can create a new one by living in a suitable structure for at least 1 week. A relictner who spends more than 24 hours away from its bonded ruin becomes fatigued and shaken until it returns to the ruin.  </p><p><strong>Ruin Sense (Su)</strong> A relictner is instantly aware of any creature that dies within its bonded ruin, as well as the direction and approximate distance of the dead creature.  </p><p><strong>Weathering Aura (Su)</strong> A relictner radiates an entropic aura of decay and disrepair. All objects within 30 feet of a relictner, including held and worn nonmagical objects, have their hardness reduced by 5, to a minimum of 0, as long as they are within the area of the weathering aura and for 1 round after leaving the area. This is a curse effect.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>A relictner mortic is two entities in one: a vicious, grasping curse and its half-undead dwarven host. The hosts resemble gaunt, prematurely aged dwarves, their hair gray and ragged, their faces nothing but masses of wrinkles. The curse, however, is a strong and subtle thing, rotting and weathering everything the relictner sees or touches until only ruins are left. Outcast and eternally bitter, most relictners remove themselves to abandoned halls and forgotten ruins that they remake into shrines of mortal despair, filling their new homes with traps and pitfalls to snare the unwary.  A typical relictner stands about 4 feet tall and weighs 125 pounds.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p> Sometimes, when a dwarf survives the affliction of a mummy's curse, a sliver of that dread power remains in her blood, lying dormant for years or even generations. The curse mutates, and its host mutates in turn to become  the half-dead creature known as a relictner. The two grow together in a kind of twisted symbiosis, until it becomes hard to tell where the relictner ends and its curse begins. Removing a relictner's curse (possible only with <i>wish</i> or miracle) kills it instantly, as the curse has long since taken over the host's vital biological functions.  Soon after its curse manifests, a relictner feels an urge to claim some kind of structure or building as its own. A relictner considers its home a vital part of its being, much like a hermit crab's shell, and few relictners willingly leave their chosen lairs. A relictner forced to leave its home experiences bouts of twitchy, agoraphobic mania interspersed with melancholic lethargy. This is not to say that relictners don't sometimes grit their teeth and travel-a relictner is an intelligent creature, after all-but it takes quite a lot of motivation.  A relictner's curse encompasses its chosen home, weakening it, desecrating it, and turning even the greatest example of dwarven architecture into a barely standing ruin within a matter of months. Relictners' ruins are places where terrible accidents can happen with little warning, and where lives can be lost in sudden structural collapses. Relictners themselves are almost never in any danger, however. The mortic's curse may not be alive in any conventional sense, but it does have some tiny spark of awareness, enough to make a point of never harming its host.  Whenever someone dies inside the cursed ruins of a relictner, the mortic feels a sudden rush of energy and confidence as its curse fulfills its true purpose. The more painful, agonizing, and despair-ridden the death, the greater the subsequent high. The same ability also makes it easy for relictners to stalk prey within their domiciles, as they can usually find survivors nearby.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  A few relictners try to hide in larger dwarven society, though their destructive aura makes it difficult- people tend to notice when fine dwarven workmanship falls to pieces in a matter of weeks, and to dwarves, relictners are nothing less than abominations, horrific blasphemies that by their very nature destroy everything that dwarves strive to create. Those relictners who manage to hide do so by pretending to be older than they are and by living in slums or shantytowns, places where one more ruined building won't be remarked upon. More often, though, relictners are  exiled or forced out. These bitter outcasts seek existing ruins, where they either live alone as hermits or in small, orderly clans, and from which they plan their revenge on the living.  Relictner ruins tend to be terrifying places to visit. Relictners generally seek out the most impressive ruins they can find, ideally those with curses or undead residents of their own-relictners are immune to other jinxes, and they get along very well with liches or mummies, offering service in exchange for residence. They are expert trapmakers and delight in devising creative ways to violently mutilate and kill their victims.  Of course, creating traps that never get triggered is boring, so relictners routinely lure visitors to their ruinous homes. Particularly duplicitous relictners have even been known to hire adventuring parties as unwitting meat for their grinders, finding these capable targets a satisfying test for their skills.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Tyrants_Grasp.jpg","_id":"sIRTxDeMWJWH4i1i"}

These divine spells are considered arcane spells for the tletli, meaning that the creature does not need a divine focus to cast them.  </p><p><strong>Stoke Flames (Ex)</strong> Once per round when a tletli attacks with its wings, it can cause areas of active fire within 30 feet to spread as a free action. An affected 5-foot square of fire spreads to one adjacent square that is not on fire, possibly burning objects or creatures in that space. The tletli determines which adjacent squares are set on fire.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Of all the couatls, tletlis are among the most vengeful and easily the most actively destructive, channeling their righteous fury to rid Golarion of large swaths of evildoers. While some couatls may offer redemption to evil individuals, a tletli withholds salvation and exacts punishment on whole sects of people whose crimes they deem warrant oblivion. Tletlis do not hunt down individuals, instead targeting gangs, corrupt governments, and even entire settlements that they believe have fallen beyond redemption.  The tletli is a terrifying sight to behold. Its wings are continually shrouded in flame, ranging from warm orange at the base to hot blue at the tips, causing the air around the couatl to radiate with an ominous <i>light</i> best described as apocalyptic. Further magnifying the effect, the beast's opalescent scales seem to reflect a divine <i>light</i>.  A typical tletli is 35 long with a wingspan of 25 feet. It is one of the heaviest couatls, weighing nearly 6,000 pounds.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p> The tletli has a unique connection to the powers of the firmament, even compared to other couatls. The divine intensity of a tletli's fire is so great that it can penetrate the defenses of even creatures made from flame, and its conflagration is infused with holy power that can wreak devastation among evil outsiders, dragons, and undead.  Tletlis rarely gift their sacred feathers to mortals, but when they do it is a true honor, and one that bestows great power upon the recipient of the holy item. A tletli's freely given feather acts in all ways as a couatl's feather (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</i> 49), allowing a spellcaster to use it as an additional material component to cast <i>planar ally</i> to conjure that specific tletli without expending the typical payment of gold or other valuables-provided the tletli approves of the service asked for by the spellcaster. Alternatively, a tletli's feather can be used as an additional material component while casting any damage-dealing spell with the fire descriptor; in this case, the spell gains the benefits of the Maximize Spell metamagic feat, and the spell uses up a spell slot 3 levels higher than the spell's actual level.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  A tletli appears only as a last resort, when a particular settlement or area has become filled with irredeemably evil individuals. Ghost towns overrun with undead, blighted forests plagued by evil fey, and interplanar portals that act as gateways for devils or demons are all likely targets for a tletli's wrath. In addition to their worship of righteous deities such as Sarenrae and Torag, tletlis serve a disproportionate number of empyreal lords, enacting swift justice on behalf of mighty angels and archons like Ragathiel, Olheon, and Damerrich. Like their masters, they assume the role of divine executioners, meting out the most extreme discipline possible to agents of vileness.  Although tletlis are near legendary in terms of their scarcity, those who recognize these massive creatures for what they are quickly understand the destruction soon to come. Legend tells that tletlis were more prominent on Golarion shortly after Earthfall as they worked to fight the evils that arose during the Age of Darkness.  If and when a tletli is called upon to obliterate an irredeemable region, the couatl enlists mortals to aid its efforts, typically in the form of envoys and delegates who extend a final chance for redemption to the sinners in question. A tletli's prerogative, however, is punishment, not  mercy, and woe be unto any who cavort with the wrong kind of company at the wrong time in a tletli's presence. If there are genuine innocents within a group or settlement on which the tletli has set its sights, the couatl may send an emissary, such as a charmed person, to forewarn the pure of heart, but it otherwise does not hesitate to incinerate the entire locale. Their deific masters understand tletlis' unrivaled propensity for holy retribution all too well, and they typically send other couatls or celestials like angels to accompany the tletlis in case there are a number of individuals in a settlement that should be evacuated or protected during the razing.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Tyrants_Grasp.jpg","_id":"tU0ZXdKKUghVG4G9"}

When a barrier breaker troop reaches 0 hit points and is destroyed, it bursts violently outwards, and creatures within or adjacent to the troop take 4d6 points of acid damage.

In addition, it deals double its troop damage (normally 4d6) against such barriers and unattended objects. When a barrier is destroyed with this ability, it  explodes and deals an amount of bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage equal to 1d4 points plus 1 point per point of the object's hardness to creatures within 5 feet of the object, including the barrier breaker troop.  </p><p><strong>Volley (Ex)</strong> A barrier breaker troop can hurl a barrage of rocks and debris as a standard action.

Affected creatures take a -2 penalty on ability checks, saving throws, attack and weapon damage rolls, and skill checks. This is an emotion and mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Life-Draining Aura (Su) At the start of a melacage's turn, each creature within 30 feet that is affected by the melacage's despair ability takes 1d4 points of negative energy damage, and the melacage becomes corporeal for 1 round. It loses the incorporeal subtype and gains a Strength score of 20. Its deflection bonus to AC becomes a natural armor bonus, and its incorporeal touch attack is replaced with two bite attacks. It loses its fly speed and gains a base speed of 30 feet. A creature within the melacage's aura at the start of the melacage's turn can allow itself to be affected by the melacage's despair ability (as if it had failed the Will save) in order to trigger this ability.  </p><p><strong>Rejuvenation (Su)</strong> A melacage exists because it is not aware of how it died. Explaining to a melacage how it died destroys it permanently. If the melacage is destroyed but it still does not know the circumstances of its death, it rejuvenates fully in 1d10 days.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>In a world with powerful spells, silent monsters, and a long history that can often affect the present in unexpected ways, death-even mass death-can sometimes come as a surprise. While souls may move on, the sudden feelings of loss and confusion can be left in the world as psychic imprints, and if enough of those feelings exist in one place, they can combine into a melacage. A melacage stays near the place where it formed, trying to transfer its crippling depression to a living creature so that it can become corporeal and investigate the cause of its death.  An average melacage is around 2 feet in diameter, with four to five humanoid faces on the outside of its body.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p> Melacages are usually created in the aftermath of a great, tragic event. This could be anything from the collateral damage of a wizard's duel to a group of subterranean monsters causing lethal tremors and a sudden sinkhole. Whatever that event, it often has these two qualities: it affected a large group of people at once, and that group of people had little to no warning that it was coming.  Because a melacage is created by lingering emotions and not souls, the number of deaths that it takes to create one of these creatures can vary from one melacage to another. Sometimes the psychic imprint of an entire village will come together to form one melacage, while other times it takes only two or three sudden deaths. A major factor in the creation of melacages comes from the victims' outlook on life while they were alive; a group of happy-go-lucky, optimistic people might be devastated by their sudden deaths and form many melacages, whereas a group of down-on-their-luck folk who were barely scraping by might barely form one. Gnomes in particular are vulnerable to forming melacages, as their whimsical nature and vivacious lifestyles can make their unexpected deaths all the more traumatic, though gnomes who have survived the Bleaching almost never form part of a melacage.  The fact that melacages are formed from lingering emotions and not souls also causes trouble for necromancers who try to create them. Since most spells focus on a corpse or a soul, it is hard to find a spell that targets the essences required to create a melacage; while it can be hard to covertly find the appropriate corpses necessary for casting <i>animate dead</i>, it can be even harder to quietly kill a large number of people in an unexpected and sudden way. These circumstances mean that academic  work on creating melacages is severely lacking and advanced only by unscrupulous professors' side projects.  The faces of a melacage reflect those who provided the emotions that formed it, although in the case of a melacage created by the confusion and sorrow of a large number of people, the faces are often amalgams of the originals. Bits and pieces of the original creatures' memories remain, mostly having to do with what the creatures were doing when they died. When accessing an individual person's memories, the melacage rotates so this particular face is showing, which can lead to a dizzying discussion if the melacage tries to access multiple different memories at once.  A melacage that becomes corporeal falls onto the ground with a sickening splat as it simultaneously loses the ability to fly and gains real skin. Such a melacage is reduced to rolling around on the ground to move, and it must attack with its mouths instead of using its incorporeal essence to drain the vitality from other creatures. Despite being brought to the ground, melacages maintain much of the speed they had in their incorporeal forms, and they are able to quickly roll after any victims who try to escape.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Melacages are only as common as the events that create them, which means they tend to be fairly rare. Melacages can show up anywhere, but they form mostly in urban environments. Due to their connections with great tragedies, often the places where they reside are ruined and abandoned.  Melacages cannot recall the events that lead to their creation, and they cannot rest until they know the reason for their being, yet they are often prevented from investigating their deaths by their own melancholy and despair. This means that their first priority is to find something or someone else to host their overpowering emotions. This has the dual benefits of allowing them to mentally focus on their investigations and allowing them to become corporeal and therefore able to move physical objects in their quests. However, the necessary proximity to the new host of their depression and the damage their emotions inflict upon that creature can lead to misunderstandings of the melacage's intentions, so such attempts often end in violence.  While a melacage doesn't mind working with people who are investigating its death, its tumultuous and misery-stricken mind can often cause it to become confused as to who is actually helping and who is causing it harm. If a melacage is able to transfer its misery to someone else, the melacage usually becomes easier to  reason with. Removing a melacage's anguish can also help people who have figured out the cause of its deaths and are trying to convince it they have discovered the truth, as the emotional shock of discovery makes it difficult for the melacage to make sense of what anyone tells it, and it often denies that such stories could possibly be true.  Due to their tendency to live in isolated areas, melacages are only rarely reported, usually after adventurers have already removed them. There have been some strange rumors coming out of Nirmathas, however, of a village where melacages seem to be forming for no reason. Given the villagers' preparations for Molthuni aggression, they've so far been able to take care of the melacages with minimal harm to themselves, but they remain flummoxed as to why the undead creatures are being created in the first place. The village is offering a sizable reward for anyone who can figure out the cause and deal with the situation permanently. Current theories point to an underground city that befell tragedy, but no one has been able to locate it.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Tyrants_Grasp.jpg","_id":"yhWIso20fQD2b9r0"}
