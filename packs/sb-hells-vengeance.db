Only chaotic and neutral (non-lawful) creatures are harmed by this energy, which deals 10d6 points of damage to chaotic creatures (or  10d8 points of damage to outsiders with the chaotic subtype) and slows them for 1d6 rounds (as per <i>slow</i>). A successful DC 26 Will saving throw reduces the damage by half and negates the <i>slow</i> effect. This ability deals only half damage to creatures that are neither chaotic nor lawful, and they are not slowed. Such a creature can reduce the damage by half again (down to one-quarter) with a successful DC 26 Will saving throw. A hammer archon can use this ability once every 2d4 rounds. The save DC is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Immovable Object (Su)</strong> When not in the archon's possession, a hammer archon's lucerne hammer can be picked up or moved by only another hammer archon or a lawful outsider of at least the same CR as the hammer archon. A hammer archon's lucerne hammer has double the hardness and 50% more hit points than a normal lucerne hammer. This quality persists for 24 hours after the hammer archon's death.  </p><p><strong>Inevitable Sunder (Ex)</strong> When a hammer archon attempts a sunder combat maneuver against an item held or wielded by a chaotic- or evil-aligned creature (or a creature with the chaotic or evil subtype), the hammer archon ignores the target item's hardness.  </p><p><strong>Reverberation (Ex)</strong> A hammer archon's body is harmonically attuned to provide it with extraordinary defenses. The archon is immune to bludgeoning damage. Additionally, whenever a character strikes a hammer archon with a weapon (magical or nonmagical), the weapon takes 3d6 points of damage. Apply the weapon's hardness normally. Weapons that take any amount of damage in excess of their hardness gain the broken quality.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Hammer archons are the unstoppable champions of celestial armies, called to fight against paragons of evil and chaos when all hope seems otherwise lost. Their powerful hammers sweep through lesser enemies and shatter <i>shield</i>s and weapons with ease. Each hammer archon's plate armor gleams like polished silver and resists even the strongest blows from hammers and other bludgeoning weapons.  A hammer archon stands 10 feet tall and weighs approximately 900 pounds.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Those archons who continually proves themselves in battle, either by striking down hordes of demons or by holding back a single pit fiend long enough for reinforcements to arrive, may get promoted to the rank of hammer archon. This process can take centuries, even millennia, but the lawful-aligned outsiders would brook no shortcuts. Many hound archons and <i>shield</i> archons with martial inclinations ceaselessly endeavor to rise to the heights of power that being a hammer archon represents.  The most ambitious hammer archons strive to prove themselves worthy of becoming star archons (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2</i> 32), often taking on positions of authority in important conflicts. Those who show they can lead squadrons of other archons to victory against overwhelming odds or can make tactically sound decisions under pressure take the first steps to a legendary transformation. Other hammer archons are content to remain as they are, with the knowledge that an army with too many generals and not enough soldiers is no kind of fighting force at all.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Hammer archons spend the majority of their time on the fields of battle, whether assaulting an outpost of Hell or clashing with legions of daemons over a nexus of power on the Material Plane. Unless injured by a particularly potent foe, these archons require only brief respites before charging back into the fray. When not fighting, hammer archons struggle to not betray their impatience to re-enter conflict. They pass their idle hours polishing their armor and maintaining their lucerne hammers. As such, the areas of Heaven where these celestials reside are often filled with the rhythmic sound of hammers ringing against steel.  A hammer archon without his hammer is a diminished version of himself, so each archon fervently guards his weapon, sometimes forming such a deep bond with it that it gains a modicum of sentience. Though not fully intelligent, these weapons respond to their owners' moods with noticeable alterations of the symbols on their heads and hafts. No matter what, a hammer archon who is divested of his weapon in the heat of battle ignores all other threats until he can retrieve it. This sometimes forces the archon to make poor strategic choices, a fact that savvy foes take advantage of when fighting one of these celestials.  Hammer archons often have only cursory relationships with other hammer archons. They are usually sent on solo assignments or asked to lead armies of other celestials, so they rarely have opportunities to interact with one another. When they do, they speak only of past conquests in cool but cordial tones. A hammer archon knows that others of his kind are unflinching followers of law, so he never questions the others' actions or decisions. When required to act as a team, hammer archons understand that the situation must be dire indeed. They discuss strategy with the same professional attitude, and often reach a consensus very quickly.  Though hammer archons and <i>shield</i> archons (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2</i> 31) vary greatly in rank and strength, they sometimes form close ties. The hammer archons see themselves as mentors to the other celestials,  offering advice and providing opportunities for the <i>shield</i> archons to gain the power they need to ascend. More often than not, these relationships prove to be quite dangerous for the <i>shield</i> archons, as the hammer archons drag them into battles that are well beyond their capabilities. However, those few <i>shield</i> archons who survive these ordeals gain enough experience to take class levels and eventually transform into more powerful archons.  Many hammer archons share a particular hatred for mariliths. These demons can possess a martial prowess equal to that of hammer archons, and are usually at the command of fiendish armies. A marilith's many bladed weapons can bypass a hammer archon's damage reduction and immunities, so hammer archons seek to sunder them before they can cause too much damage. A battle between a hammer archon and a marilith is an awe-inspiring sight to behold, as the two titans struggle to gain advantage over each other.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Hells_Vengeance.jpg","_id":"4LUlvjwN7RntCTwv"}

A mote archon swarm does not require a healer's kit to treat deadly wounds.  </p><p><strong>Vibrating Combustion (Ex)</strong> As a swift action, a mote archon swarm can vibrate rapidly for 1 round, heating the air and dealing 3d6 points of fire damage (Reflex DC 26 half) in addition to swarm damage at the end of its turn. Creatures that begin their turns in the swarm's area risk catching on fire (see page 444 of the <i>Pathfinder RPG Core</i> Rulebook). A creature that succeeds at its save against this ability is immune to catching on fire at the start of its next turn. A burning creature can't attempt to extinguish itself as long as it is in the mote archon swarm's space. The save DC is Constitution-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Mote archons are tiny, floating runes less than an inch across. Individually, they are benign and nearly mindless creatures, but mote archons are virtually never found alone, congregating naturally in groups of hundreds or thousands of their kind. Together, these swarms of mote archons have a unified personality and an overwhelming drive to comfort the sick and <i>heal</i> the injured. They are most often found on the battlefields of Heaven tending to injured angels and other archons, and never hesitating to defend creatures under their care. Angry mote archons oscillate rapidly until they ignite and swarm over enemies with fiery retribution.  A mote archon swarm has no appreciable weight.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Mote archon swarms are sparkling heralds of comfort and succor. Each mote archon within a swarm is a tiny, virtually mindless creature as light as dandelion fluff. A mote archon has the form of a spherical rune with sharp edges. No two mote archons seem to have the same shape, but because the tiny creatures glow brightly, their exact form is difficult to discern. Their glow is a white light the strength of a candle flame; unlike lantern archons, mote archons cannot change the strength or color of their glow.  Mote archons naturally gravitate to the nearest of their kind, floating erratically over or around obstacles as they move toward each other. When clustered in swarms of a few hundred individuals, they develop a hive mind and a distinct personality. This personality is as mutable as the swarm itself; a mote archon swarm that loses a few dozen members might become grim or despondent, while a swarm that gains more members becomes cheerful. As mote archon swarms speak little, these differences in temperament often manifest through the lethargy or agitation of individual lights within the swarm. Regardless of their current personalities, mote archon swarms remain driven to help the sick or injured and cannot stand idle in the face of suffering.  Although they are creatures of healing, mote archon swarms are easily angered. The surest method to anger a mote archon swarm is to threaten harm to any creatures it deems under its care. A mote archon swarm is also enraged by acts of senseless butchery or wanton violence. When roused to anger, a mote archon swarm descends upon its enemies with righteous fervor. As each mote archon has sharp edges, a darting swarm of the creatures can shred skin; however, the swarm has sufficient control over its component motes for it to flay enemies but leave allies unharmed. When infuriated, the individual components of the swarm oscillate rapidly until their rage ignites them.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Mote archon swarms are rarely found outside of Heaven, where they tend to injured angels and archons in the wide pavilions that celestials use as hospitals. Celestial armies commission mote archon swarms as field medics, and the glittering swarms accompany the Heavenly forces in their wars against the legions of evil. In these great clashes, mote archon swarms dart about the battlefield, attacking foes while healing allies. A mote archon swarm's desire to <i>heal</i> sometimes overcomes its better judgment, however, and it might staunch an enemy's mortal wound or target a desperately injured enemy along with its allies when it uses its <i>mass cure light wounds</i> ability. Mote archon swarms see this not as an error, but as a measure of grace that lowers the aggregate amount of suffering in the universe.  Mote archons are generated as a celestial byproduct during the ascension of an archon into a more powerful form. An archon who has served Heaven as a warrior or crusader produces few or no motes, whereas a diplomat or peacemaker might produce as many as a dozen, and an archon dedicated to easing suffering and healing the sick might engender dozens of motes each time it ascends to a higher form. The motes thus produced are mindless, inclined to do no more than seek out others of their kind and avoid causing harm. (A mote caught between these two directives-such as a mote cupped in clasped hands that could escape only by slicing free with its sharp edges-simply oscillates in place until a resolution presents itself.) Only when motes gather in large numbers does a personality appear, but this is independent of the personalities of the archons who shed the component motes.  Mote archon swarms tend to act more spontaneously than other archons. When creatures under their care have recovered sufficiently, mote archon swarms abandon the immediate area, giving in to wanderlust. Mote archon  swarms encountered outside of Heaven have usually slipped through a portal or gateway in such meanderings. Although these itinerant swarms find healing work to occupy their time, they eventually pine for the familiar fields of Heaven.  Mote archon swarms enjoy the company of other celestials dedicated to healing. They particularly admire brijidines and sometimes follow these fiery azatas with exuberant devotion. Eventually, a mote archon swarm's adoration gives way to irritation over an azata's flighty recklessness, however, so the swarm returns to the more serious business of tending to the sick or wounded.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Hells_Vengeance.jpg","_id":"5jQH9Mnxxy5T9FQn"}

This baleful gust lasts for 1 round, and creatures and objects within a 15-foot radius of the gale spirit are affected as if by a <i>gust of wind</i>. Additionally, when the gust begins, the howling winds deal 4d6 points of sonic damage to creatures in the area. A successful DC 18 Fortitude save negates the <i>gust of wind</i> effect and reduces the sonic damage by half. The gale spirit is immune to this ability's effects. The save DC is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Create Spawn (Su)</strong> A humanoid slain by a gale spirit becomes a gale spirit in 1d4 rounds. These spawn are less powerful than typical gale spirits, and take a -2 penalty on d20 rolls and checks, have 2 fewer hit points per Hit Die, and only deal 1d6 points of negative energy damage. Spawn are under the command of the gale spirit that created them until its destruction, at which point they lose their spawn penalties and become free-willed gale spirits. They do not have any of the abilities they had in life.  </p><p><strong>Lifesense (Su)</strong> A gale spirit notices and locates living creatures within 60 feet, just as if it possessed the blindsight ability.  </p><p><strong>Unnatural Aura (Su)</strong> Animals don't willingly approach within  30 feet of a gale spirit, unless their master succeeds at a DC 25 Handle Animal, Ride, or wild empathy check.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Gale spirits are the remnants of wicked individuals who have fallen a great distance through the air-usually from bridges or mountainsides-and died alone, broken on the ground, while cursing the world for leaving them to their terrible demise. These malicious creatures haunt the places of their deaths, hungrily seeking victims with whom they can share their fate. Although they are not typically friendly with any creatures, even others of their kind, gale spirits do occasionally work with each other in combat; the result is often a terrible, haunted place of howling winds and spooky terrain that is as unnerving as it is deadly.  Gale spirits resemble 2-foot-tall, disembodied heads with twisted features that are eerily similar to those the creatures had in life.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Gale spirits' facial features are the only physical remnants of the individuals they once were. Each gale spirit is still recognizable to those who knew the creature while it lived, even though the undead horror's seething rage twists its features into something unnatural. A cold blue glow emanates from its translucent face, and wisps of spirit essence trail behind it. Whirling winds typically following the spirit, leaving undulating patterns on the ground as it passes above. This wind screams louder and louder when the gale spirit circles in preparation for a fight, sounding like a gust mixed with screams of agony. Sometimes, gale spirits that had personal ties to the creatures they are attacking convey taunting or tormenting words along with their gales, but more often than not, gale spirits merely scream and howl unintelligibly as they descend upon their victims.  A gale spirit retains some of its former personality, though the murderous rage that plagues its mind greatly warps its outlook. Even when it's not attacking, it is capable of speech, though it hardly ever sees any reason for conversation when it comes to the living. A gale spirit rarely has any goals beyond visiting suffering upon others; in this way, gale spirits make their own tortured existence more bearable. If a gale spirit can still feel any measure of happiness, it is only when it is staring at the broken bodies of multiple victims of its whipping winds, waiting for them to rise as its spawn.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Throughout Golarion, there are deadly drops with particularly ominous reputations: bridges that cross deep canyons, thin paths atop sheer cliffs, abandoned manors built on mountains, and waterfalls hundreds of feet tall. Some of these places are tied to myths about specific villainous individuals who fell to their deaths there; less commonly known, however, is that many of  these myths are actually origin stories for the gale spirits that haunt these areas. Some even say that gale spirits take pride in residing in places with particularly dangerous reputations, and that they sometimes purposely leave straggling survivors to ensure that their malevolent reputations continue to grow. However, it's unclear whether such pride is characteristic of gale spirits in general, or if individual spirits simply embody the trait.  Often, such a haunted place's dangerous reputation stems from these angry spirits' activities rather than the natural danger its geography presents. After a gale spirit begins to haunt a place, bodies are often found on these places' precipices rather than solely at their bases. Strangely, although it seems impossible for these victims to have fallen to their deaths, the ground surrounding each of these bodies appears to be a point of great impact.  Though a gale spirit's spawn tend to haunt the same areas as their progenitor, sometimes forming ravenous packs with their creator, gale spirits usually ignore others of their kind. The exception is typically in combat, when gale spirits sometimes join forces to try to destroy as many living creatures as possible. In places where their numbers have swelled, gale spirits tend to become more communicative. If a traveler listens closely enough, words are audible along with the constantly howling wind up to a mile away. Such phrases are almost always terrible threats or macabre boasts, spoken in Common in a chorus of eerie, barely discernible voices.  Gale spirits are most common in rural areas, particularly in mountainous terrain or in forests with extreme elevation differences. They are found in all climates and wander their territories at all times of day, although they tend to avoid bright daylight, which makes it hard for them to see. For this reason, gale spirits attacks are most common at night. Darkness offers them cover from which to surprise victims, kill them, and turn them into hateful progeny. Gale spirits and their packs thrive best in secluded areas that nonetheless have regular foot traffic, which provides them with a slow but steady influx of potential victims. Nearly forgotten religious shrines or abandoned temples of minor deities with dangerous precipices nearby are choice hunting grounds for a gale spirit or two. Although it's uncommon, some particularly old gale spirits even roam from the sites of their mortal death to other, more dangerous or notorious places that are better suited to attracting victims. Even then,  a gale spirit rarely changes its lair more than once in a hundred years.  With its wide swaths of rural, mountainous areas-not to mention its preponderance of villainous individuals since House Thrune seized control of the nation- Cheliax is home to a large number of gale spirits. The northern Menador Mountains, as the location of many evildoers' hideouts over the years, have been a particular hotbed for the creatures. Some of Cheliax's more active gale spirits have even been known to venture forth from the mountains onto the plains north of the Barrowood and Whisperwood. Rumors hold that, outside of towns such as Kantaria, the howling of the winds on stormy nights is not a simple weather phenomenon but a chorus of angry gale spirits looking for new victims. An old folktale even tells of murderous triplets from Kantaria who supposedly committed suicide together by jumping off a bluff in the northern Whisperwood rather than face judgment for their crimes. It's said that the siblings joined together to form a massive, supremely deadly gale spirit that actively tries to lure unhappy citizens from Kantaria into the woods. Such stories are often told to scare children into behaving well, but scholars believe there might actually be some truth to them, and that certain gale spirits with such terrible origins might be far more powerful than those born from lone deaths.  Varisia, with its massive Storval Rise and towering Thassilonian ruins, is also a gale spirit hotbed. Scholars posit that Varisia is home to some of the oldest gale spirits in the Inner Sea region, and that some existing in the most rural locales may even have been Thassilonian slave masters. In the wilds outside of Magnimar, it is also rumored that there are a handful of gale spirits that are friendlier to mortals than others of their kind. These gale spirits are said to work with living partners-supposedly individuals who knew the gale spirits while they lived-to lure unsuspecting victims to their territories, where the gale spirits brutally murder them. These gale spirits supposedly have tribes of progeny that number a dozen or more. Their aims in building these tribes-and whether they are under the influence of even more sinister forces-are unclear.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Hells_Vengeance.jpg","_id":"EfO5UC7vZlog6OS3"}

While they have lived on the Material Plane for millennia, lythiriums are actually descended from primordial beasts native to the First World-creatures that fused plant and animal so seamlessly they seemed both and neither simultaneously. Peering out of seedpod eyes that radiate a soft green glow, lythiriums have exceptionally keen senses; they are not shy about preserving their forests, and they deliver their warnings in rasping voices reminiscent of leaves blowing across the earth.  At its haunches, a lythirium measures 6 feet in height, with thorns, vines, and flowering blossoms inching ever higher. Its massive body is a matrix of vines, roots, and fine, furry moss and lichens. Immense branches shape its powerful chest and limbs. From thorny head to tail, a lythirium measures 9 feet in length; it can weigh as much as 900 pounds.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Scholars believe the first lythiriums wandered onto Golarion through a breach to the First World in the nation now known as Kyonin or through a long-healed breach in the Barrowood or Whisperwood in what is now Cheliax (though the latter is considered less likely). Lythiriums' First World progenitors are believed to have been even more massive than the beasts that exist today. Most posit that they had even stranger physical qualities than do Golarion's lythiriums, such as the ability to infuse victims of their gore attacks with various poisons or diseases. The folktales that tell of such creatures in the First World are ancient and contradictory indeed, but one detail never wavers: these creatures were always said to take the forms of antler-bearing wolves, and to have senses appropriate to such pack hunters, despite having features of both elks and plants. These tales have died out among modern peoples, though, leading scholars to believe that-for  whatever reason-lythiriums native to the First World no longer exist. However, the creatures' descendants live on in the densest forests of Golarion, patrolling their territories and acting as friends and allies to those who share their goals of keeping forests safe.  Perhaps owing to their odd origins on the First World, lythiriums have a strange physiology. Foliage and reedy roots intertwine to form the creatures' shape and size, and their central roots pump greenish, saplike fluid throughout their bodies. The small seedpods that constitute a lythirium's eyes are opaque, fluid-filled sacs that emit a greenish glow. These give the creatures sharp vision, even in the dimmest light. In extreme darkness, the pod-eyes extend outward from the sockets like antennae, and sense subtle vibrations in the air. This allows lythiriums to see even in total darkness.  Lythiriums survive by absorbing sunlight through their leaves and by scavenging the meat of animals that died naturally. However, despite their canine appearances, lythiriums don't hunt creatures for food, and kill only if they are attacked first.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Considering their immense size, lythiriums are able to move swiftly through the underbrush and foliage of the forested regions they inhabit. Though their native habitats are full of thick, dense forest that would impede the movement of any other beast of a similarly bulky size, lythiriums' unique ability to pass through plants unhindered enables them to continue their unyielding hunts against those who would harm their homes. It also ensures that they can use their own nature-manipulating abilities without being negatively affected themselves.  When the season changes and temperatures drop, lythiriums' colors deepen to fiery red, burnt orange, and plum. Their leaves begin to fall as winter approaches, and lone lythiriums seek out caves or other sheltered places in which to hibernate during the winter, when they go dormant.  Perhaps driven by instincts their kind developed on the First  World, lythiriums often seek out wolf companions and sometimes even attempt to supplant an entire pack's hierarchy. Despite their peaceful nature, though, lythiriums are shunned by most wolf packs because of their disturbing appearance and pungent scent of earth and vegetation, which wolves tend to find both strange and unappealing.  Lythiriums are rare and seldom encounter others of their kind. When chance meetings occur, lythiriums bond quickly. Although they seek to dominate the few wolf packs that accept them, lythiriums are remarkably egalitarian when living among their own. They have a complex communication system ranging from barks and whines to growls and howls, all tinged with the sound of rustling leaves.  While in its territory, a lythirium assists good-aligned adventurers and creatures against evil foes when it sees such fights break out. If adventurers approach a lythirium respectfully with news of threats against its territory, the creature does whatever is necessary to help end the menace. Lythiriums' intelligence and protective nature make them useful confederates for good fey creatures, though they also usually consider elves and gnomes to be natural allies.  Though the dense terrain in which lythiriums live is enough to keep most intruders away, they constantly patrol their surroundings. A lythirium's vigilance grows if virtuous folk make their homes within its territory. Many communities of forest-dwelling elves refer to lythiriums as vinewolves and usually welcome their presence when settling a new region, going as far as to hollow out dead, massive trees in the hope that lythiriums might hibernate nearby and protect them.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Hells_Vengeance.jpg","_id":"FaTJehyWOvyB6XHK"}

An erelim receives a +4 bonus on melee attack rolls on a charge while mounted (instead of the normal +2), and does not take any penalty to AC after making a charge attack while mounted. In addition, if an erelim confirms a critical hit on a mounted charge, the nearby area is washed in holy <i>light</i>. Each evil-aligned enemy in a 20-foot-radius burst takes 2d8 points of damage and is blinded for 1 round. A successful DC 15 Will saving throw reduces the damage  by half and negates the blinded effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Inspiring Presence (Ex)</strong> When an erelim is mounted, all good-aligned allies within 60 feet that can see the erelim receive a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls and weapon damage rolls against evil-aligned creatures.  </p><p><strong>Righteous Challenge (Ex)</strong> Three times per day, an erelim can challenge evil foes. As a swift action, the erelim chooses one target within sight to challenge. The erelim's melee attacks deal 2d4 additional points of damage to the target (or 2d6 points of damage to evil outsiders). The erelim takes a -2 penalty to AC, except against attacks made by the target of the challenge. An erelim's challenge and additional damage only apply to evil-aligned creatures; if an erelim attempts to challenge a creature that is not evil, that use of challenge is expended for the day with no effect. The challenge remains in effect until the target is dead or unconscious or until the combat ends.  </p><p><strong>Shining Mount (Su)</strong> As a standard action, an erelim can conjure forth a quasi-real mount made of pure <i>light</i>. This functions as per <i>phantom steed</i> (CL 8th), conjuring a mount with an Armor Class of 18, 15 hit points, a speed of 100 feet, and the ability to run or charge over sandy, muddy, or marshy terrain without penalty. The mount glows with a brightness equivalent to a day<i>light</i> spell. Only the erelim who conjured it can ride the mount, and the erelim must be astride the mount to use celestial charge and inspiring presence. An erelim can dismiss the mount as a free action.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Erelims serve as cavalry in celestial armies, charging into battle atop steeds of pure <i>light</i> and inspiring allies with valiant words and deeds. These angelic knights laugh in the face of overwhelming odds and love nothing more than to face destruction without fear, even going so far as to scorn armor. Honorable and respectful, erelims obediently follow the commands of celestial generals, but sometimes their fervor for righteous battle makes them frustratingly difficult to organize or call to retreat.  Erelims appear as a variety of humanoid races from the Material Plane, though usually with dark, close-cropped hair. An erelim's wings are smaller and more elegant than those of other angels. A typical erelim stands 6 feet tall and weighs 180 pounds.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Erelims arise from the souls of valiant mortals who fell honorably in battle, or who died defending the weak against insurmountable evils. Many paladins, cavaliers, and other crusaders find themselves among this legion after death, but even a humble peasant may find herself among the knights of Heaven so long as she stood up to evil while others backed down. The appearances of the angels may vary greatly from the mortal forms they  once inhabited, and many erelims arise from the celestial planes spontaneously-from wisps of soulstuff collected from a dozen or more brave petitioners-rather than emerging from a single, courageous warrior. They may present a huge variety of racial features in one stunningly beautiful and athletic form.  Erelims who stand out thanks to cunning and resourcefulness in battle-for all erelims are blessed with bravery and prowess-are sometimes \"promoted\" to higher angelic choirs. If erelims can be said to covet anything, it is the title of deva.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Erelims are best suited for combat on the open fields of battle in large-scale conflicts between the forces of good and evil. They depend heavily on their shining mounts- projections of their own radiant souls-as their wings are smaller and weaker than most of the angelic host. Most guard the borders of Heaven, or ride across the yawning planes of Elysium on constant patrol for protean intruders. They serve as the cavalry for celestial forays into the evil Outer Planes, but lack the cunning and restraint to act as covert agents. Despite their zeal, erelims are careful to avoid civilian injuries or destruction, and work to steer conflicts away from unaffiliated settlements.  Very rarely, erelims take mortal form on the Material Plane to act as knights or field marshals for armies they deem righteous. These erelims are fair but uncreative strategists, relying heavily on straightforward tactics and superior numbers to win the day. While erelims see any resulting casualties as a failure of their leadership, they tolerate the deaths so long as an important objective is won in the process. Erelims on the Material Plane attempt to disguise their celestial nature, only reverting to their true forms in times of desperation. Once danger has passed, such revealed erelims return to the Outer Planes.  The concept of relaxation is alien to erelims. Their free time is filled with endless drills, jousts, patrols, and short breaks to maintain their weapons or strategize with other angels. Such a warlike existence leaves them suited for little else. Even in times of peace, most erelims find it difficult to lay their duty aside and embrace simple pleasures; without some measure of routine, many become anxious and reactionary, seeking conflict even when engaged in the most mundane activities.  Erelims who serve together in a celestial formation share a camaraderie akin to that of many mortal armies. Members of an erelim formation learn to act in harmony, and grow as close as siblings, able to coordinate and work together without speaking a word. Multiple formations brought together into a single host often develop friendly  rivalries, becoming especially competitive in battle, to the point of recklessness. Celestial commanders frown upon this divergence in the ranks, but can rarely discourage the boisterous angels for long.  <strong><br />Calling an Erelim</strong><br />  Erelims can be called with <i>planar ally</i>, and the payment they require depends on the boldness of the request. These angels belittle any tasks that don't test their mettle or call for incredible heroism, and demand to be presented with extravagant weapons or for large sums to be donated to an appropriate church. Conversely, they exuberantly agree to requests that put them in direct conflict with powerful evil beings, and often ask no more of the callers than to fight alongside them as equals. Erelims do not accept obviously suicidal tasks, but sometimes vastly underestimate the threat mortal dangers can pose.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Hells_Vengeance.jpg","_id":"M5lqLcwHlfH03iEa"}

Any attempt to cast a spell within this area while the discordant field is active requires a successful concentration check (DC = 15 + double the level of the spell being cast). If this check fails, the spell is lost and the spellcaster must make a successful DC 24 Fortitude save to avoid being staggered for 1 round by magical feedback generated by the field (this is a mind-affecting effect). Spellgorgers are immune to the effects of this ability. The save DC is Constitution-based.  </p><p><strong>Engulf (Ex)</strong> When a spellgorger engulfs a creature, the ooze can choose to maintain a bubble of air around the engulfed creature's head so that it need not fear suffocation. An engulfed creature gains the pinned condition as normal, but does not take any additional damage from being engulfed.  </p><p><strong>Firebolts (Su)</strong> As a standard action, a spellgorger can expel up to four bolts of burning magical force. It can direct these firebolts at any target within 60 feet (no range increment) but cannot target a single creature with more than one firebolt. A creature struck by a firebolt takes 2d6 points of fire damage and 2d6 points of force damage.  </p><p><strong>Immune to Force Effects (Ex)</strong> A spellgorger is immune to force damage, and can pass through force effects (such as those created by a <i>forcecage</i> and a <i>wall of</i> force) as if they did not exist. When it attacks a target, it ignores any armor bonuses granted to that foe from force effects (such as those created by <i>bracers of armor</i>, <i>mage armor</i>, and shield).  </p><p><strong>Parasitic Spellcasting (Su)</strong> If a spellgorger has engulfed a creature capable of casting spells, it can cast any one of the creature's known spells that has a casting time of one full-round action or less (using the spell's casting time as normal); when it does so, it is treated as the spell's caster. The spellgorger must supply any components for casting the spell in question-if the spell requires the use of focus or material components, the spellgorger can use any components carried by the engulfed spellcaster as if it had those components. A spell cast in this way is considered expended by the engulfed spellcaster, and all spell effects resolve at the engulfed spellcaster's caster level (but are not further enhanced by feats or abilities the engulfed spellcaster may have).  </p><p><strong>Prehensile Tendrils (Ex)</strong> A spellgorger's tendrils are capable of fine manipulation, such as that required for somatic components when casting spells or handling material components. It cannot use these tendrils to effectively wield weapons, but can use them to activate relatively small handheld magical items like wands (though not larger items like staves).  </p><p><strong>Scent Magic (Ex)</strong> A spellgorger has the scent ability, but can smell only creatures with active spell effects or magic items that exude magical auras.  </p><p><strong>Spell Healing (Su)</strong> Whenever a spellgorger uses its parasitic spellcasting ability, it regains a number of hit points equal to double the level of the spell it cast. If the spellgorger is at maximum hit points, it gains temporary hit points equal to this amount instead. These temporary hit points do not stack. A spellgorger gains no sustenance (or healing) from casting 0-level spells in this manner.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Spellgorgers are among the more terrifying threats that face an adventuring spellcaster-shapeless entities that  feed on magic. Rarely encountered in large numbers, spellgorgers are most common in remote reaches of the Darklands, where they often prey upon the numerous spellcasting races that dwell below, such as the drow, duergar, derro, and svirfneblin. A spellgorger prefers the \"taste\" of arcane magic, but can feed on divine and psychic magic as well.  A spellgorger resembles a floating sphere of violet sludge that exudes a slithery forest of fine tendrils and sparks of magical energy. A typical specimen is 10 feet in diameter and weighs 1,000 pounds, but spellgorgers' supernatural ability to fly and swift reflexes belie their massive bulk and weight.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  The original spellgorgers, like so many of the stranger magical predators of the world, arose from failed magical experiments. The most pervasive theory of their source is an attempt by drow wizards to solidify raw magic and give it life in a fleshforge-making a magical spell into a free-willed, living creature.  Spellgorgers feed on magic, but the method by which they do so is not only unusual, but also highly disturbing and unsettling to spellcasters. In order to feed, a spellgorger first engulfs a spellcasting creature. It then pulls prepared magical potential from its engulfed victim, effectively stealing spells and casting them to serve its own agenda (often using these stolen spells to defend itself from the engulfed victim's allies). When a spellgorger casts spells in this parasitic manner, it is able to absorb the magical \"runoff\" from the spell as sustenance. This act is performed without deliberate malice, despite how humiliating it is for spellcasters who have been parasitized in this way. Indeed, a spellgorger does not benefit from the death of an engulfed spellcaster, and these creatures often go to great lengths to keep their victims alive. Once a spellgorger has expended all of its victim's spells, it generally expels the spellcaster, likely unharmed save for being entirely drained of magic, and moves on to seek other prey. A spellgorger is capable of using many magical items as well, but curiously, it cannot feed from magic within a scroll, wand, or other device-something about the mixing of organic life and the act of spellcasting combines in just the right way to nourish these curious creatures.  When they grow too large, spellgorgers reproduce through spontaneous fission.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Spellgorgers are remarkably intelligent and have an uncannily strong sense of self and personality. Scholars suspect that much of this is a side effect of the nature of their feeding-that when spellgorgers consume magic from an engulfed creature, they retain a slight trace of that creature's intellect and charisma. Then, as the spellgorgers reproduce, this store of mental acuity is handed down through the generations rather than lost upon death. If true, at some point in the future, spellgorgers may count themselves as some of the most intelligent forms of life on the Material Plane.  Yet despite their intellect, most spellgorgers are content to waste their minds in private philosophical debates. While they may engage in long, complicated discussions with their prey, when two spellgorgers meet, they often form strong bonds and eagerly discuss all matters magical. Curiously, spellgorgers directly related by fission do not get along well at all, and are prone to violent arguments; for this reason, when a spellgorger splits, its two \"young\" generally seek new homes far from one another.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Hells_Vengeance.jpg","_id":"MRLosh6t91Uesu4Q"}

In the deal, Savu allowed two of his bodyguards to each sire a colt with mortal Keleshite mares. The resulting hybrids- one coal-black with a blood-red mane and tail, the other dark gray with a fiery-orange mane and tail-became the legendary founding specimens of the two strains of the stygian hot-blooded horses. Combat-trained stygian hot-blooded horses fetch prices of up to 1,500 gp apiece.  Other than their unusual coloration, stygian hot-blooded horses' most distinctive characteristics are arched necks, refined heads, and high-held tails. The horses' meat has the flavor of smoked chili peppers and is considered a delicacy in many cultures, although their Keleshite breeders consider it an abomination to consume such fare. Stygian hot-blooded horses are bred to be fast, spirited war horses. Quieter and more intelligent than most horses, they're also ideal for raids that require stealth.  Stygian hot-blooded horses stand 5 feet tall at the shoulder and weigh approximately 1,000 pounds.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Hells_Vengeance.jpg","_id":"MpMQ0pfOEEhlTnk2"}

They must move their full movement speed in straight lines every round, making their slam attacks and grabs without stopping. A lapsudaemon doesn't lose altitude or speed for aerial maneuvers and makes no Fly checks when changing directions. It \"falls\" vertically, horizontally, or diagonally and attacks any creature in its  way, regardless of the number of creatures in its path. It can change directions each round to maximize the number of creatures it can slam, moving through other creatures' spaces without the need for an Acrobatics check regardless of their size, but it still provokes attacks of opportunity, and it can only attack a particular creature once per round. It can fall at its full speed while grappling a single creature without needing to succeed at a check to do so; while grappling, it can make slam attacks only against the grappled creature, and it can't use its grab ability.  Lapsudaemons are immune to effects that change their movement speed or alter their flight ability, even if the effect would be harmless or beneficial. Lapsudaemons don't take damage from falling or from bludgeoning attacks. The only exception is that any lapsudaemon somehow prevented from moving takes 1d6 points of damage each round for every 30 feet it doesn't move. So great is the creature's supernatural propulsion that forcing the lapsudaemon to remain still eventually tears it apart.  Because lapsudaemons shout in horror as they fall, if a creature can hear, it can always notice the sound of a lapsudaemon's presence with a Perception check DC of -10, regardless of the daemon's Stealth.  </p><p><strong>Momentum (Ex)</strong> When a lapsudaemon makes a slam attack while moving into a creature's square, the attack deals an additional 1d6 points of damage for every 10 feet that the lapsudaemon moved since the last time it made a slam attack or struck a surface, to a maximum of 20d6. This damage isn't multiplied on a critical hit.  </p><p><strong>Must Come Down (Su)</strong> Any flying creature struck by a lapsudaemon must succeed at a DC 22 Will save or lose its ability to fly for 1 round. Such a creature falls until it regains the ability to fly or it hits the ground, whichever comes first. This affects both natural and magical flight. This doesn't dispel magical flight effects, but instead suppresses them (functioning similar to <i>antimagic</i> field) for 1 round. When a lapsudaemon dies, it unleashes this ability a final time on all creatures within 30 feet. A creature falling for 1 round generally falls 200 feet. The save DC is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Vertigo's Grace (Su)</strong> A lapsudaemon's constant motion protects it from attacks. It gains a deflection bonus to AC equal to its Charisma bonus.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>A mortal that dies hopelessly after a sudden fall may eventually serve the Four Horsemen as a powerful lapsudaemon. On the bleak plane of Abaddon, these awful creatures exist in a state of perpetual plummeting, never ceasing their movement. Even when addressed by ranking daemon lords, lapsudaemons never stop their falling motion or incessant screaming. Their lieges frequently must teleport to some great height and fall with them to maintain telepathic conversation. Lapsudaemons always shriek as they fall-a residual impulse taken from the last moment of their mortal lives. Loud cries and cold blasts  of wind herald their approach as they teleport into combat mid-fall and continue their merciless assault.  Lapsudaemons attack their victims by falling into them, whether they approach vertically or horizontally. They frequently employ spell-like abilities before attacking as many enemies as possible in melee, colliding for one mighty strike against each target until every foe is dead. When not outnumbered, they prefer to murder their nonflying targets by pushing them from ledges or carrying them to great heights before releasing them to their doom.  A lapsudaemon appears as a crushed human-often an amalgamation of the parts of several victims of such terminal tumbles seamlessly fused together. Its limbs protrude at awkward angles and strike out as it collides with its enemies. A lapsudaemon is between 5 and 6 feet tall and weighs 150 pounds.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Unlike other daemons, lapsudaemons actively reproduce their own kind by searching out vulnerable creatures and dropping them from cruel heights. Longer gambits involve the daemons tracking down a gullible adventurer and offering the victim a deeply desired prize, high atop a mountain or spire. The desperation of the climb, combined with the hopelessness of a fatal fall, launches the dead soul to the volcanic peaks and stone towers of Abaddon. From the new lapsudaemon's perspective, the fall never ends. It slips out of the mortal realm only to land in its new, tortured afterlife, and then commences an eternity of perpetual motion.  Calling lapsudaemons is a difficult and sadistic affair. They prefer a sacrifice of wings cut from a living celestial being, bound to, and then born aloft by, a willing intelligent creature, who must fall to his or her death as part of the calling ritual.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  While most daemons have at least a modicum of subtlety and manipulative savvy, the average lapsudaemon falls far short of the mark in that regard, and so lapsudaemons are primarily employed by ambitious harbingers as killers for hire. Powerful mortals bring lapsudaemons to the Material Plane to engineer fatal \"accidents\" that kill their rivals while avoiding any suspicion of foul play. When a lapsudaemon finds itself without a task assigned by its liege, it typically retreats to some lofty aerie and spends its time ceaselessly  falling toward the ground and teleporting high into the air just before impact. In the highest places of their home plane, storms of lapsudaemons fall from the sky like an apocalyptic rain. These screaming storms can last for months or years before enough lapsudaemons are called away to work elsewhere and the maelstrom subsides.  While on other planes, lapsudaemons display an immediate grasp of local climate and geography. They naturally hide themselves far from civilization, where their constant falling and shouting goes unnoticed. They favor abandoned ruins and uninhabited wastelands that resemble their blasted home.  Lapsudaemons are intelligent and cruel, but their plight allows them little opportunity to focus on studies or more advanced machinations. As such, they focus almost exclusively on tasks assigned by more powerful daemons. They frequently serve immortal harbingers such as Uaransaph or Geon, evil deities like Zyphus, or the Four Horsemen as assassins or insane heralds of an imminent military force. Where legends speak of a storm of falling daemons dropping mortals from the sky, they also speak of the ruin of entire city-states shortly thereafter.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Hells_Vengeance.jpg","_id":"NTzjHCr2uX7OxpRG"}

They despise polluters and those who use water to cause pain and suffering, such as the captains of slave ships. This attitude remains constant, despite nualidus' tendency to make and break relationships with others in moments.  These azatas are constantly on the move, rarely staying in one place for very long. Their persistent need to travel makes it difficult for nualidus to complete any but the simplest of tasks in an amount of time most mortals would find acceptable, but nualidus have long memories. An individual nualidu might return to a location hundreds of years later to finish a job they started, even if everyone else involved long ago forgot or died of old age. Nualidus also act similarly in combat, flowing between opponents and across the terrain, only to flee if they become bored. They rely heavily on their natural powers and spell-like abilities to shove foes around the battlefield.  Nualidus are made recognizable by the elemental water making up much of their lithe, sylvan forms, which draw down into long, serpentine tails. This water constantly churns; no matter what kind of surface a nualidu travels across, their waters remain clean and fresh. A nualidu's hair color ranges from the sparkling blue of tropical waters to seafoam green, and matches that of their twinkling eyes. A typical nualidu stands a little over 5 feet tall and is quite slender, weighing only 130 pounds.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Nualidus form from the souls of virtuous members of aquatic races, or else from the souls of moral people who spent the majority of their lives near or on water, such as kind dockworkers, sailors, and lighthouse keepers. Little remains of their mortal traits or memories upon their creation, aside from hazy memories of sunsets upon the waves and familiar ports of call, which nualidus might spend the entirety of their immortal existences trying to locate. Their bodies are clear and cool upon creation, but darken considerably with age, until their roiling forms resemble the blackest oceanic trenches.  Nualidus generally spring from the waters of Elysium, in the strongest concentrations of chaotic influence, and it is no coincidence they are extremely capricious and impermanent. From their personalities to their long tails, the aquatic outsiders resemble proteans as much as they do their fellow celestials, and whispers up and down the planes claim that they are the children of some ancient god's dalliance with a protean lord. Proteans are widely varied in their relations to the curious azatas, with  many considering nualidus distant kin while others see them as a mockery of proteans' ideally chaotic forms.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  When not on Elysium, nualidus travel natural waterways and oceans, experiencing the extremes of the natural world. They tolerate manufactured canals to a much lesser extent, as such courses are often polluted by the mortals who created them. If the source of the contamination seems readily apparent, a nualidu usually attempts to rectify the problem regardless of locals' needs or wishes. In most cases, though, the issue is endemic of civilization, and no nualidu can stand to remain in one place long enough to change an entire society.  A nualidu has no permanent place of residence and generally eschews shelter, preferring to rest under the stars on beaches or in underwater caves. Despite their mercurial and transient nature, these celestials are very community-oriented, forming small pods of like-minded individuals who travel together to pursue a common interest or goal. Nualidu pods fluctuate constantly as members find other interests or new members join, but when together, pods are as protective as any human family. To threaten or insult one nualidu in a group is to threaten or insult the entire pod.  More so than other azatas, nualidus relish courtly titles, and often invent grandiose new ones, accumulating a long list of honorifics as time passes. Most eventually grow bored with titles they're accrued and shed them without a second thought, only to collect new ones during their next journeys. The more bombastic and flamboyant a title, the longer it holds a nualidu's interest and remains part of their name. While their epithets tend to reference their exploits and triumphs, nualidus are no strangers to exaggeration. Some particularly pretentious titles include \"the Marquis of a Thousand Waves,\" \"the Exalted Maharajah of the Unstoppable Current,\" \"the Jubilant Savior of the Laughing Stream,\" and \"the Grand Caliph of Inundations, Bane of Droughts.\" A nualidu's titles might be both masculine and feminine, as their attitudes toward gender are as fluid as their personalities.  Nualidus despise anything they see as a perversion of their treasured water, especially human drinks such as coffee, tea, and alcohol. They look down on all who drink such abominations, considering them classless at best, and directly insulting at worst. Depending on the nualidu's mood, the outsider might either politely refuse such an offered libation or launch into a screed demonizing the substance and all the harm it has caused mortalkind. A particularly incensed nualidu may even go so far as to  seek out the nearest brewery or winery and destroy it. This attitude rarely extends to naturally derived fluids, such as fruit juices and plant nectar.  <br /><strong>Calling a Nualidu</strong><br />  A nualidu can be called with <i>lesser planar ally</i>, although it is very difficult to call the same nualidu more than once. The azatas prefer tasks that contribute in some way to the protection or cleaning of a body of water, and generally accept payment with gems or valuable stones that have been eroded by flowing water into unique and organic shapes. They also demand at least a token amount of respect from their callers, and most nualidus require their callers to treat them politely and to memorize, if not directly use, at least a handful of their myriad titles.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Hells_Vengeance.jpg","_id":"OapDBq1JkiYySs1p"}

Mederachs once spent all of their time on their home plane, serving as healers and teachers to the azatas, angels, titans, and others creatures alongside which they lived; among themselves, mederachs delighted in discussing the nuances of the honest virtues they held in such high esteem, including kindness, charity, and mercy.  As societies formed on the Material Plane, mederachs heard tales of mortals' changeable morality with interest and concern. Mortals, they came to believe, have souls that are inherently good, but that are also easily corrupted when exposed to prolonged suffering or extraplanar evil forces. During the Age of Darkness, mederachs heard of the various misfortunes and evils that had descended upon the lands of Golarion, including the falling of the <i>Starstone</i>, the collapse of major empires, and the rampages of the nascent demon lord Treerazer. Believing that these events would imperil the souls of all the world's mortals, mederachs began experimenting with plane-shifting; once they honed this ability, they began making regular forays to Golarion to aid good creatures in the fight against overwhelming evil. Now, in addition to embarking on these missions, mederachs also sometimes travel to the source of such evil plots-often the Abyss-and work on mortals' behalf there. However, no matter where their journeys take them, mederachs always keep in mind their belief that most evil can be redeemed, and so they seek to subdue their enemies and turn them toward good whenever possible instead of destroying them outright.  Mederachs are typically 10 feet tall and weigh about 2,000 pounds.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  On Elysium, mederachs still occasionally serve as teachers and mentors for their native neighbors. In recent millennia, however, they've spent their time at home honing their hunting skills, for their experiences working with virtuous partners on the Material Plane has taught them they must be skilled hunters and combatants if they wish to effectively fight evil. They find plenty of creatures on Elysium willing to participate as the prey in mock hunts. Mederachs rarely remain in Elysium for extended periods, preferring to put their skills to use on the Material Plane or even in the Abyss once they feel comfortable doing so.  To their credit, mederachs use peaceful methods to subdue their targets whenever they can. However, they have an instinctive, burning hatred for evil arachnid creatures, reserving the greatest enmity for bebiliths, whose malevolence mederachs believe is a mockery of the good they themselves try so ardently to accomplish.  They also have no qualms about destroying unintelligent evil creatures, especially mindless undead, reasoning that these monsters serve as mere shells for the forces of evil and deserve no quarter.  Mederachs hunt like typical web-spinning spiders, leaving a nigh-invisible web in the path of potential targets. They often elect to deal nonlethal damage to foes they think they can reach through dialog. During combat with such foes, they relate grand tales of supposedly irredeemable tyrants who saw the error of their ways and became benign rulers.  Mederachs acquired the ability to change their appearance, which they use when they travel among those who might fear their true forms, or who might mistake them for evil bebiliths. Although they can change shape into many types of animals, they tend to choose familiar forms, such as horses with golden manes or riding dogs with golden coats. Their arachnid nature subtly manifests while they're in alternate forms, usually represented by eight toes on each paw, or scarlet dots on their heads representing extra eyes.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Around others of their kind, mederachs are especially conversational and friendly; a convening of mederachs is often a talkative and somewhat disorderly, if polite, affair. They enjoy relating tales of their journeys to other planes and of creatures they have turned from evil or, regrettably, destroyed. Mederachs also enjoy discussing intricate web patterns based on designs they have witnessed in the stars or on other planes. They establish no formal hierarchy among themselves and regard each other as equals.  Mederachs' egalitarianism extends to their fellow good-aligned outsiders. Of course, they have their own biases and preferences regarding such creatures. They view many lawful good outsiders, especially archons, as too rigid in their pursuit of righteousness. Archons, on the other hand, view mederachs as powerful but overly idealistic and optimistic fighters. The lawful good celestials still seek alliances with mederachs, however, when doing so would benefit their plans. Mederachs are usually open to such offers, but these collaborations tend to dissolve quickly once the creatures achieve their mutual goal.  Mederachs find many neutral good outsiders to be eminently helpful when the need arises; in their own pursuit of good, agathions in particular are open to assisting mederachs with nonviolent plans. When agathions embark on ambassadorial missions to other planes, mederachs often accompany them,   both to further their own schemes and to cement the friendships they often have with their allies. Mederachs also frequently work with angels, although when they do, it usually involves the angels intimidating the powerful evil creatures mederachs hope to turn to good. Of course, their angel allies tend to have their own inscrutable aims in mind when they go along with mederachs' plans, which can sometimes lead to minor discord between the celestials.  Of all the other good outsiders, mederachs have the most in common with azatas, who are also natives of Elysium. While azatas can be aimless in their pursuit of championing good wherever they tread, mederachs are more focused architects of such plans, and so the two make excellent partners in many situations. In such relationships, the strong-willed azatas may insist on taking the lead when carrying out plans or suddenly change their minds about the best ways to achieve the partnership's collective goals. Yet they are surprisingly willing to admit their errors in judgment or personality flaws, leading to friendships and partnerships that rarely truly sour despite minor setbacks. Beyond threatening one of their own, the best way to truly rile mederachs is to harm their azata companions.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Hells_Vengeance.jpg","_id":"TBlzGAckFkCSBiGA"}

Doing so requires the ukobach to succeed at a DC 15 Wisdom check as it impresses its will upon the fire. This DC increases by +5 for every size category of the flame above Small. If it's successful, the flame animates and follows the ukobach's mental commands, functioning as a fire elemental of the same size. The flame remains animate for a number of rounds equal to the ukobach's Wisdom modifier- usually 3-after which it returns to being simple flame, setting the square it ceases moving in alight or being extinguished, as its surroundings warrant.  </p><p><strong>Ember (Ex)</strong> An ukobach can hurl a red-hot ember as an improvised thrown weapon that deals 1d6 points of fire damage. A thrown ember has a range increment of 10 feet.  </p><p><strong>Fire Leap (Su)</strong> As a swift action, an ukobach occupying the same space as a fire, a pool of lava, a vent of searing steam, or a similar blaze (such as the fire plumes in the smithy ruins) can teleport from that burning feature and emerge from another within 100 feet. This ability functions similarly to <i>dimension door</i>, but only between fires. Upon entering a flame, an ukobach is instantly aware of all flames within range through which it might exit. If an ukobach enters a flame and there are no others to exit through within 100 feet, the devil's movement immediately ends and it is stunned for 1 round.  </p><p><strong>Fire-Breathing (Su)</strong> An ukobach can spend a standard action to guzzle a pint of oil, alcohol, or a similarly flammable fluid and hold the combustible liquid within its body. At any point within 10 minutes of doing so, the ukobach can ignite and expel the liquid as either a 10-foot cone or a 20- foot line of fire, dealing 3d6 points of fire damage (Reflex DC 14 half). Once it has breathed fire, an ukobach cannot make use of this ability again until it drinks another pint of flammable liquid.

It regains the ability as soon as it finishes consuming such a corpse that has died within 24 hours.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Infernal scholars have long debated the origin of the Avernus razorback. Some claim the beasts came into being fully formed as a manifestation of the malice and hate birthed by the unforgiving landscape of Hell's first layer. Others theorize an infernal duke or archdevil once led a massive herd of daeodons to Avernus from the Material Plane to drink from the River Styx and feed on the foul reeds growing amid the waters of Eridanos; over countless generations, these fell influences infused the survivors with the essence of Hell.  Whatever the genesis of these beasts, they now roam Avernus in huge packs that even most devils avoid. Powerful and fierce, they are territorial animals with a ravenous hunger for both plant and animal life. Their strange Hell-empowered digestion not only devours the body, but also obliterates the soul, ripping a creature's very life essence out of the multiverse entirely-a fate that scares even the denizens of Hell.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Avernus razorbacks are the most versatile of omnivores, and will eat all manner of grasses, scrubs, and meat, no matter the condition they're in. The beasts prefer the fresh corpses of living creatures (sentient beings most of all), as it not only nourishes their bodies but also empowers their magical nature. Razorbacks that don't eat a fresh corpse on a regular basis lose their infernal ferocity ability. But these aggressive creatures don't wait to happen upon a corpse; they actively hunt their prey, with a viciousness more akin to that of wolves than swine.  Mating within a herd or a plague happens nearly constantly on Avernus and the other layers of Hell, and gestation is a mere 4 months. The spawn, once birthed, have to fend for themselves, though mature females try to protect the young creatures from males in the grouping, which are quick to scoop up the babies as a quick but unsatisfying snack. Thus do only the strongest and meanest of young razorbacks survive their first year of life. While boars and daeodons nurse their young, female Avernus razorbacks lack the anatomy to do so. In order for spawn to grow up strong and fierce, they must hunt and feed upon fresh corpses. This magical energy sustains the spawn like mother's milk would a terrestrial mammal, and without it, the spawn weakens and is abandoned, trampled, or devoured by the adult males.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Once native to Avernus alone, the razorbacks have expanded their territories to the other layers of Hell, though not as deep as Nessus, due in part to Asmodeus's strategic use of Nessian warhounds to guard his borders, as the Prince of Lies sees razorbacks as a blight  and refuses to let them linger for long in his domain. Strangely, razorbacks typically do not fare well outside of Hell. While they can survive for a time elsewhere, their prodigious breeding activity is greatly diminished when they are away from Hell's infernal energies. The Pit's greatest minds postulate the razorbacks need the waters of either the marshy ocean of Eridanos or the lethargic run of the River Styx to trigger their breeding cycle, though a handful of breeders on other planes have cast some doubt on such a theory, claiming an alchemical formula can replicate the catalyst throughout the multiverse.  Razorback groupings are ruled by the largest and meanest female. She has to be strong enough to cow the other females into obedience, and to keep the far more aggressive but typically smaller males in check. The females of a group wage a constant war for dominance, with older, weaker females quickly supplanted by younger, stronger candidates for leadership. On the rare occasions when a male claims dominance over a group, its days are inevitably numbered-a male alpha will eventually tear the group apart through its own aggressive nature and unthinking hunger.  Domesticated Avernus razorbacks are sparse outside of Avernus itself, in part because the savage boars often turn on their masters. In Cheliax and other mortal realms where people are used to treating with the forces of Hell, some brave or foolhardy souls keep Avernus razorbacks to assist them in getting rid of their political enemies without leaving any physical evidence or chance of resurrection in their wakes.  Among those who know about these secret razorback farms, rumors circulate that some of the infernal livestock have escaped and begun breeding in the Chelish wilderness. Skilled hunters have attempted to track the beasts to verify the rumors and hopefully end the threat they pose, but no evidence of razorback plagues in the wild has yet come to light. That the beasts' victims have no corpses to discover leads many to believe no evidence is to be found.  <br /><strong>Byproducts</strong><br /> The strange gastric peculiarities of Avernus razorbacks aside, these animals are coveted for a number of byproducts particular to the species. The blood, meat, and tusks can all be harvested for special use, as detailed below.  <br /><strong>Avernus Razorback Blood:</strong> The fresh blood of the Avernus razorback seems to keep some of the strange soul energies of the digested for a period of time. As long as a razorback has feasted on a sentient creature within the last month, it can be slaughtered and its  blood harvested in place of a blood sacrifice of a sentient and even innocent creature, for up to 1 week after the slaughter occurs.  <br /><strong>Avernus Razorback Meat:</strong> Though it may seem strange given the beasts' diverse, often disgusting, and sometimes morbid eating habits, the meat of the Avernus razorback is a delicacy craved throughout Cheliax, especially in Egorian. Connoisseurs of the infernal flesh say that you can taste the hate of the beast, which adds to its delectable flavor. Not only that, the meat acts as a mild narcotic. See page 236 of the <i>Pathfinder RPG GameMastery Guide</i> for complete rules on drugs and addiction.  </p><p><strong>AVERNUS RAZORBACK MEAT </strong> </p><p><strong>Type </strong>ingested; </p><p><strong>Addiction </strong>minor, Fortitude DC 18  </p><p><strong>Price </strong>100 gp  </p><p><strong>Effects </strong>1 hour; +1 alchemical bonus to Strength and Constitution  </p><p><strong>Damage </strong>1d4 Wisdom damage  <br /><strong>Avernus Razorback Tusks:</strong> The tusks of the largest razorback can be fashioned into vicious daggers, and count as 151 gp worth of raw materials needed in the creation of a masterwork dagger. A successful DC 26 Craft (weapons) check and 1d3 days of work are required to create a masterwork dagger from such a tusk.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Hells_Vengeance.jpg","_id":"UHSsmzfXdDxhqH0h"}

They are proficient with the longsword, the longspear, heavy armor, and all shields (except tower shields).  </p><p><strong>Instant Armament (Su)</strong> As a swift action, zanas can instantly equip themselves with magical armor and weapons. This grants a zana a +8 armor bonus to AC. A zana's weapon can take one of two forms, which the zana can switch between as a swift action: a <i>+2 keen thundering longspear</i> or a <i>+2 keen thundering longsword</i> and light shield. When wielding the shield,  the zana gains a +3 shield bonus to AC. This armament is a manifestation of the zana's life force and disappears if the zana is killed. A zana can dismiss these armaments as a free action.  </p><p><strong>Petrifying Glance (Su)</strong> As a standard action, a zana can target a creature within 30 feet with a petrifying glance. The target must succeed at a DC 25 Fortitude saving throw or be turned to stone permanently. A zana can use this ability a number of times per day equal to their Charisma modifier (minimum 1). The zana can later touch the petrified creature to return it to normal as if they had cast <i>stone to flesh</i>. The save DC is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Protective Aura (Su)</strong> All allied creatures within a 10-foot radius of the zana are immune to charm and fear effects.  </p><p><strong>Sitebound (Ex)</strong> A zana is bound to the mountain they call home and can never stray beyond its foot. Each day the zana spends away from the mountain, they must succeed at a DC 25 Fortitude saving throw or take 1d6 points of Constitution damage that cannot be healed until the zana returns to their mountain. Eventually, any zana separated from their mountain dies from this damage.  </p><p><strong>Unearthly Grace (Su)</strong> Zanas are imbued with unnatural grace. A zana adds their Charisma bonus as a resistance bonus on saving throws and as a deflection bonus to AC.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>From Cheliax to the Mwangi Expanse to far-flung Tian Xia, nearly every culture on Golarion has legends about fierce and beautiful fey warriors who defend their wild, lofty homes and the innocents who visit them. These wondrous, protective spirits are called zanas, the guardians of the mountains.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Zanas are both male and female, possessing the ability to shift from one gender to the other. Each zana has a unique identity in either form, but both forms have the same strength and skill. They sometimes favor one identity over another, but often use both to confuse others, making visitors think that the mountain is populated by more than one protective spirit. If zanas are familiar with a visitor, they might playfully shift between forms without warning, just to see what kind of reaction they can get.  Zanas most closely resemble half-elves, though they are rarely mistaken for members of a humanoid race. Poets who write of them have said they embody the best physical qualities of many races in one being. Zanas tend to be tall and athletically built with slightly pointed ears and almond-shaped eyes. They are usually clad in light clothing or wear no clothing at all. When threatened or moved to defend others, they can conjure forth armor and weapons with but a simple thought.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  A zana calls a single mountain home, though not all mountains host one. Why one mountain hosts one of these  fey and another will not is a mystery. Those mountains that do are known as places of power, but also places of peace where one shows respect to nature and is kind to children for fear of the spirits' reprisals.  Zanas follow those who travel on the mountainside. If they determine the travelers are worthy, or if bribed with milk, sugar, and other good foods, zanas may reveal themselves and serve as teachers or guardians. Sagas have been recounted of noble scions retreating into the mountains for decades after their houses fell, only to return to the world with impressive fighting skills. Zanas have been responsible for at least some of the cases in which those stories are true.  Zanas tend to be secretive, but are sometimes found lounging in pools or gently running streams. They are usually good-natured, especially if approached peacefully. They might even be persuaded to assist their visitors if they deem the cause worthy. In particular, they always help children in need. Many lost children have returned to their families and told of a powerful man or woman who protected them from monsters or \"bad people\" and then helped them find their way home.  Those who invade a zana's territory with the intent to harm the land or people under the fey's protection find they face a dangerous foe. When hunters discover strangely realistic \"statues\" on a mountain's slope, they know that hapless fools somehow managed to enrage a zana, who can petrify enemies with a single glance. When thunder rolls down from certain mountains, the locals say that zanas are battling enemies with their magical weapons.  Zanas are related to bardhas- the \"white ones.\" While zanas are spirits of mountains' sides and peaks, bardhas dwell underground and are even quicker to anger. The two kinds of fey may work together if they discover derro, the bardhas' hated enemies, using tunnels beneath a zana's mountain to carry out raids on the surface world. Most of the time, however, zanas simply wander the mountainside, enjoying its majesty and watching for signs that a creature needs protection.  <br /><strong>Notable Zanas</strong><br /> The following are a few zanas of the Inner Sea region.  <br /><strong>Eilia and Leimrin:</strong> Mount Aremetrus and Gristleknob in Ustalav lie on either side of the Cauldheart. Some believe the same zana guards both mountains, but in truth, Eilia and Leimrin are twins, torn asunder by the eldritch forces that created the strange valley between them. The fey often seek goodhearted  adventurers to take gifts for one another across the Cauldheart, through which the zanas cannot pass.  <br /><strong>Marovania:</strong> The zana of Arazlant Mox on the isle of Kortos is especially powerful. Marovania may have been changed by the magic that lifted the island above the waters of the Inner Sea, for the zana has the skills of a great warrior and the magic of a mighty sorcerer. Marovania considers all of Kortos to be part of their mountain and can go wherever they wish-even entering Absalom-as long as the zana never leaves the island's shores.  <br /><strong>Rhyadid:</strong> Mount Anantisha, in the Menador Mountains, is said to hold the source of the Katharevousa River. The mountain's zana, Rhyadid, is hated and feared in Egorian because they help escaping slaves cross from central Cheliax and pass downriver to Kintargo. Rhyadid is strongly connected with the mountain's wild animals and wages war on Chelish forces who dare enter the zana's domain.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Hells_Vengeance.jpg","_id":"YVa0QV2A8A0kd8Wv"}

A bagman can stuff a grappled Medium creature in the sack, but doing so is a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity. A creature in the sack can try to cut its way free with any light slashing or piercing weapon. The sack has AC 12 and 15 hit points. If a creature cuts its way out of the sack or the sack is damaged enough to allow a victim to escape, the bagman cannot use the sack to bag prey again until it has spent 1 hour mending it.  The sack has other special qualities while in the bagman's possession. The weight of creatures in the sack do not count against the bagman's carrying capacity, and the bagman can fit up to two Small creatures or one Medium creature in the sack at a time. If used by  any creature other than the bagman that owns it, this container functions as a mundane sack. If a bagman's sack is lost or destroyed, it can craft a new sack with proper materials and a week of work.  </p><p><strong>Fat Extractor (Su)</strong> A bagman can use the fat of intelligent humanoid creatures to create <i>potions of infernal healing</i> and <i>potions of youthful appearance</i> as if it had the Brew Potion feat. These potions are created at caster level 3rd, and the fat from one humanoid creature of any size is enough to make a single potion. Creating each potion takes 2 hours, and requires the bagman to flense the fat from its victims' flesh with its claws, place the fat in a cauldron over an open fire, and mix it with whatever free ingredients are at hand. Unlike brewing a potion normally, creating these potions has no cost. A bagman can carry only four potions created in this way at a time, even if another bagman made them, but it can sell or give away an unlimited number of potions. Knowingly consuming one of these potions is an evil act.  </p><p><strong>Find Children (Ex)</strong> A bagman has the scent ability, but only with respect to humanoid children. Thus, it could sniff out a human child's hiding place, but not the child's parents.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Some monsters feed on humans, while others torture humans for their own sadistic pleasure, but few creatures go to such perverse lengths as to murder humans and then sell the processed remains back to their victims' unwitting families. Bagmen are such monsters- degenerate fey creatures who specialize in kidnapping humanoid victims and harvesting their fat to produce potions. Bagmen disguise themselves as traveling peddlers and apothecaries, often selling the products of their depredations to the very communities from which they steal their victims. An average bagman stands 5-1/2 feet tall and weighs close to 300 pounds.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Bagmen are nomadic creatures, traveling from town to town to peddle their disgusting wares. They prefer to travel by lesser-used roads, or even through stretches of wilderness, the better to happen upon lone travelers. Bagmen are opportunistic hunters, and rarely bother to set up ambushes or execute convoluted plans. If one happens upon an individual it thinks it can kidnap without repercussions-especially if that individual is sleeping or otherwise unable to properly defend himself-it simply snatches that person up and adjourns to a more private location to kill the person and harvest his fat.  Children are an exception to this rule. Bagmen greatly value the fat of children, and employ a variety of tricks and threats to lure children away from the safety of their homes and families. When a group of children is traveling with just one or two adults, bagmen delight in attacking the group and bull rushing the weakest children away  from their protectors; once the children have scattered, the bagmen find it much easier to snatch them and abscond with them to their lairs. Despite being far stronger and tougher than the average human, bagmen are quite cowardly. They eschew fighting with armed creatures, and hesitate to attack when outnumbered by combatants.  Many claim that bagmen consume the fat they harvest from their victims for sustenance, and in many cultures the name for bagmen directly translates to \"fat-eater\" or \"fat-stealer.\" However, this accusation is largely false, and is most likely based on bagmen's waxen flesh and greasy complexions. In truth, fat is the one part of a creature a bagman almost never eats, having far greater use for it as an ingredient in horrifying potions it lures unsuspecting customers to imbibe. The rest-muscles, bones, organs, and all-the bagman consumes with unnatural rapidity in order to dispose of any evidence of its crime.  It is unclear whether bagmen are capable of reproduction, or even how new bagmen come into being in the first place. Some scholars suggest that bagmen are the result of unnatural unions among fey, or between fey and a variety of evil outsiders. A few believe that new bagmen arise when evil energies permeate a bagman's cache of humanoid fat that hasn't already been turned into potions. Others claim that bagmen spontaneously manifest as a representation of the society's willingness to consume itself, such as when the rich and powerful profit at the expense of the poor and meek.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Bagmen are adept at disguising themselves as humans, and they use this ability to spend prolonged periods of time in human settlements. Here, they sell the potions they've produced using the fat of their victims. The gold they earn from these sales is less important to bagmen than the perverse pleasure they gain from revealing the nature of their wares to their horrified customers. Of course, customers' disgust is usually short lived; those who discover a bagman's terrible secret are usually the next ones into its bag. Bagmen who worry that their secret has spread throughout a populace, or that the public is suspicious of their activities, usually flee the area immediately. This has led to more than a few hastily abandoned merchant stalls, leaving the requisite authorities to eventually discover, to their horror, the true nature of the strange being who was once living and committing terrible crimes in their midst.  While bagmen primarily delight in horrifying customers, they don't scorn the profits they garner. Indeed, bagmen are profligate spenders, and exploit their ability to pass for human to partake in all the pleasures of the flesh available in human cities. Bagmen's proclivity for  gluttony often brings them into contact with cultists of Urgathoa, and alliances between bagmen and Urgathoans can be particularly fruitful. Bagmen provide potions and scouting services to Urgathoans at a steep discount, and in return they get to join the cultists in their dark feasts and rituals.  Associating with Urgathoans has other benefits for bagmen, as well. Those who are afflicted by plagues sometimes make pleas to the Pallid Princess, and bagmen are happy to answer those prayers, albeit for a price. Bagmen relish this chance to offer <i>potions of infernal healing</i>ISWG or <i>potions of youthful appearance</i> as false cures; many potential victims see through the ruse immediately, but some of the most desperate fall for the bagmen's lies. The unluckiest ones are even willing to give in to the bagmen's demands, which may go so far as to include the lives of the afflicted person's loved ones or children, taken by the person's own hands at the bagman's urging. Other times, bagmen simply request information about their customers' families, and eventually use that information to terrible effect.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Hells_Vengeance.jpg","_id":"bhOhrympy3QvXklr"}

If a waldgeist is within 15 feet of a creature that knocks on a wooden object (for example, a tree or an item primarily made of wood, such as a wooden shield), it must succeed at a DC 20 Will saving throw or it is compelled to move toward the creature for as long as the knocking persists. While the waldgeist is moving toward the knocking creature, each time the waldgeist is attacked or is the target of a harmful effect, it receives a new saving throw. Once it is adjacent to the knocking creature, the waldgeist can act freely. Whether it succeeds at or fails its initial Will saving throw, a waldgeist is immune to that creature's knocking for 24 hours. Knocking on wood can draw a waldgeist out of a possessed tree, but not more than 50 feet from the edge of a forest or other large, wooded area.  </p><p><strong>Lignify (Su)</strong> When a waldgeist deals damage to a living non-plant creature with its incorporeal touch, it also deals  1d4 points of Dexterity damage as it begins to transform the target to wood. A creature reduced to 0 Dexterity in this way is permanently transformed into a nonmagical tree, as per the <i>flesh to stone</i> spell, but the wooden creature has hardness 5 and vulnerability to fire. In addition to <i>stone to flesh</i>, a <i>restoration</i> spell can reverse this effect.  </p><p><strong>Nature Dependent (Su)</strong> A waldgeist cannot travel more than 50 feet from the edge of a forest or other large, wooded area. A waldgeist that is forced outside of this boundary is instantly destroyed. A waldgeist receives a +4 racial bonus on saving throws to resist teleportation or other effects that would force it outside of its forest.  </p><p><strong>Possess Tree (Su)</strong> Once per minute as a standard action, a waldgeist can possess a Large or smaller nonmagical tree and animate it as if using <i>animate objects</i>, except the waldgeist merges with and controls the tree. The waldgeist cannot speak, move, or use its own attacks or special abilities while possessing the tree. When the tree is destroyed, or when the waldgeist ends the possession as a free action that provokes attacks of opportunity, the waldgeist appears in a square of its choice adjacent to the tree. (See page 91 for an example of a tree animated in this way.)</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>A waldgeist arises when a gnome who was a woodlands dweller or who had a deep spiritual connection with such an area dies while in a large forest. The gnome's spirit is twisted and bound to the trees, infused with hatred of living intruders and a need to protect the area that sustains it. A waldgeist appears as a translucent gnome-like figure surrounded by a faint, green glow, its facial features full of anger and malice.  Waldgeists become incredibly violent when faced with creatures that intrude upon their homes or that they see as threats. In combat, waldgeists attack using the forest itself, entwining despoilers' legs with roots and vines, and animating nearby trees to smash intruders with thick branches. A waldgeist is typically 3-1/2 feet tall.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Gnomes who exult in woodland life are often just as fascinated with new and exciting experiences within their demesnes as others of their kind. Unfortunately, given the dangers inherent in many primeval forests, such an outlook can be dangerous. When a woodland gnome's fanciful tree-climbing expeditions or unprepared sylvan explorations lead to disaster, sometimes her soul becomes heavy with melancholy and bitterness, and she arises again as a waldgeist. If a gnome's death can be blamed on an intruder-perhaps she was tracking an interloper when her fatal accident occurred-this undead fate is nearly assured.  Though animated by negative energy, a waldgeist must constantly remain within its forest home to maintain  its form. To a waldgeist, nothing exists outside of the forest in which it died. If it is somehow transported away from a wooded environment, it completely disintegrates with an anguished howl. A waldgeist's connection to the forest grants the spirit a measure of power over its surroundings, including the ability to possess trees and bring to them a measure of life.  Habitatand Society  Because of the highly specific circumstances required for their formation, waldgeists are rare and found only in large, old-growth forests, where the trees grow tall enough to block out the sun. Even more rarely, a tragedy of unthinkable proportions happens to a group of gnomes, and multiple waldgeists arise simultaneously. When this happens, the spirits often drift away from one another to haunt separate areas of the forest. Waldgeists are solitary creatures, hiding their presences from the other creatures of the woods, especially fey such as dryads. Although both creatures exhibit a certain protective possessiveness over nature, dryads see the undead waldgeists' capacity for violence as terribly brutish.  While waldgeists tend to shun forest natives, they hate and hunt down creatures they see as intruders in their woods. In reality, such individuals might be innocent travelers simply passing through the forest, or they may be loggers who pose a legitimate threat to the natural surroundings. To waldgeists, such distinctions are nonexistent; they view any creatures not native to their homes as enemies. In battle, waldgeists are cunning. If a waldgeist faces a group of enemies, it tends to use its magic to enhance the surrounding foliage, entangling creatures with the plants that heed its call. While its enemies are distracted, the waldgeist then possesses the nearest tree and uses its branches to wreak havoc on any within its reach.  Luckily for most adventurers, though, these wicked creatures can be easily distracted. Waldgeists are attracted to sound of knocking on wood, as it reminds them of the possibilities of interesting visitors, opening doors, or other things that once intrigued them in life. A waldgeist that fails to resist the temptation of this noise ceases its current actions in order to \"greet\" the knocker, even going as far as abandoning the tree it had been possessing.

They exist below the lowest tiers of Heaven's hierarchy and are commanders of celestial animals, holding no official place among Heaven's formal ranks or society. They dwell primarily at the base of the mountain that makes up the plane, wandering the idyllic realm alone or in great, golden herds. Despite their placid appearances, hiracapaths act as Heaven's watchdogs, running down any discovered interlopers and dragging them before more formal authorities for judgment. To hiracapaths, this arrangement is not lopsided; rather, it's preferable, as it allows them to indulge in their natural affinity for tracking intruders while remaining outside of the official celestial hierarchy, which they find too complex and unappealing, when they even consider the matter at all.  In its natural form, a hiracapath is as an intangible cloud of soulstuff and celestial energy. Heaven itself provides each glorious creature with silver and steel armor to give it both form and purpose. Clad in gleaming plates, a hiracapath stands 9 feet tall and weighs almost 1,500 pounds.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Sometimes called the \"bulls of Heaven,\" hiracapaths are born from Heaven itself, often forming from the souls of loyal mounts and animal companions of righteous heroes. Newly formed hiracapaths burst forth as jets of light and sound from the ground of Heaven's lowest tiers. Their armor eventually emerges from these same fonts hours later, beginning a long process that is equal parts birthing and unification of their disparate elements. The creatures remember nothing of their creation, and are driven only by an imbued sense of their place in the rigid hierarchy of Heaven's inhabitants.  The same force that empowers its existence allows a hiracapath to expertly sap the life energies from enemies without mortally wounding them. In spite of the hiracapath's bulk and size, its powerful blows strike an enemy carefully, and rarely draw blood or open wounds. Born trusting humanoid masters more than their own judgment, hiracapaths dread the possibility of accidentally injuring or killing a creature that deserved a kinder fate, and under no circumstances do they wish to pass judgment on any creatures themselves. Against foes immune to nonlethal damage-such as constructs or undead-a hiracapath simply wields its curled horns and powerful hooves to devastating effect, trusting that a soulless creature cannot feel the pain it brings, and hoping only to stop, rather than totally destroy, its opponent.  A hiracapath's intangible core grants it many benefits, including a shining light that burns evil and the disobedient, plus the ability to tread upon air as if its armor weighed nothing. This same holy light allows them to slip between the planes as they wish  Small populations wander Nirvana from time to time, or charge though the borders of Hell and the Maelstrom. As outsiders, they have no need to eat or sleep, but enjoy both-great herds roam Heaven, chewing thoughtfully at mouthfuls of plant matter, dirt, or stones, resembling contented herds of mortal cattle, sheep, or goats. If they spot an intruder, however, the hiracapaths do not hesitate to meet the threat head on, even if they don't wish to visit mortal harm upon it.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  After their emergence at the base of Heaven's mountain, hiracapaths swiftly define their territory, or join other hiracapath herds without much fanfare. Instinctively knowing their role, hiracapaths serve as vigilant protectors, shepherding celestial animals and guarding against threats from other planes. They suspiciously stalk new petitioners and planar travelers alike, only satisfied when they see newcomers judged worthy by angels, archons, or other celestials. Obvious threats- such as the rare fiendish incursion-are dealt with swiftly but mercifully. A hiracapath carries incapacitated foes to the nearest authority figure, and ultimately loves nothing more than praise from its celestial superiors for a job well done.  When the threat of invasion is not a concern, hiracapaths enjoy the rigid beauty of heaven. Though herd animals, they can wander off alone to spend extended periods of time in simple but careful introspection. Bold and stubborn, hiracapaths are ultimately gentle creatures who dread the thought of causing undue harm; they move with careful grace across the fields and pastures they patrol to avoid crushing smaller creatures beneath their bulk. Hiracapaths follow a simplified paladin's code, refusing to hurt helpless opponents and offering assistance to those in need. Thanks to their dull wits and prodigious strength, a hiracapath is often painfully straightforward. For instance, a hiracapath may help a lost traveler by carrying her in a straight line-through any and all obstacles-until the traveler spies familiar surroundings. Or a hiracapath may lead a wayward visitor around the mountains in a winding or circular path, waiting until it comes across a trusted angel or archon who can help direct its charge.  While hiracapaths' dogged defense of Heaven seems at odds with their ability to <i>plane shift</i>, they do use their planar traveling ability to pursue enemies who escape justice. Angels joke that hiracapaths' ability to jump between worlds is a symptom of their stubbornness- even the walls of reality can't sway one of Heaven's bulls once it eyes a target. Because a hiracapath is unable to bring a target it pursues across cosmic borders, those beasts who leave their home often regretfully switch  to deadly force, especially against infernal or other obviously evil prey.  Other times, high-ranking angels or archons gift the services of hiracapaths to virtuous mortals. The hiracapaths proudly serve as paladin mounts when so called-many filled this same role in life and vaguely recall the sense of purpose it offered. Though rare, such alliances offer valuable training a hiracapath can bring back to its herd, and the majestic beasts themselves serve as proud warriors and surprisingly capable trackers.  Though many angelic lords of Heaven view them as simple brutes and watchdogs, hiracapaths maintain a special relationship with the empyreal lord Ragathiel. The empyreal lord opens his territories to myriad herds of hiracapaths to serve as both protectors and symbols of strength, and respects the dogged and just nature of the hiracapaths, rewarding those who uproot nascent evils or track down escaped enemies. The General of Vengeance selects those hiracapaths who prove themselves worthy to wander the grounds within his own fortress, and dispatches them as mounts for his messengers and scouts in his wars against the infernal. These hiracapaths are clad in crimson-and-gold armor, and their interior nimbuses of golden light are replaced with righteous fire. Such champions of their kind have the advanced simple creature template, and often possess unique abjuration and conjuration spell-like abilities.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Hells_Vengeance.jpg","_id":"dzcvZ2jQ2uzuskK6"}

Descended from vermin that came to be trapped in Hell, typhilipedes embody the corruptive might and terrible hungers that brood in the dark. Usually encountered as wriggling, clacking masses of insectoid legs and flapping wings, these creatures strike fear in the weaker souls that trespass within the Pit. Typhilipedes possess night-black, segmented bodies with dozens of scraping, skittering legs. Two pairs of batlike wings sprout from between body segments closer to the creature's head, which bears two pairs of eyes and oversized mandibles glistening with sickly ichor.  A typhilipede typically measures 2 to 3 feet in length and rises no more than 8 inches from the ground, though its 3-foot wingspan can lift it off the ground with only minor difficulty. A single typhilipede weighs about 10 pounds.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Typhilipedes have a legendary reputation in Erebus, where it's said they hail from a place called the Wax Tower. Supposedly, this particular vault is a vast echo chamber, alive with the deafening drone of an impossibly large typhilipede swarm. At the vast space's center rises an organic-looking tower of incredible height. Millions of typhilipedes burrow into the tower's callouslike exterior, creating a network of tunnels and caverns where primordial, endlessly fecund typhilipede progenitors are said to dwell. At the tower's endlessly rising summit burns a tiny, unquenchable flame. Supposedly the entire tower was once just a single candle that an innocent mortal begged the gods to keep burning eternally. The gods granted the request, but as the candle burned, its wax dripped endlessly. In the aftermath of the resulting disaster, Asmodeus volunteered to deal with the candle. The taper that would become the Wax Tower was installed in Erebus, along with a few unfortunate gnats that had become trapped in the wax. Over ages of exposure to the darkness of Erebus and the corruption of Hell, those crawling things transformed into the first typhilipedes.  Now, typhilipedes are native to Erebus, though small colonies occasionally slip into the tunnels of the Darklands. In both places, they are considered pests, akin to otherworldly forms of giant rats or monstrous spiders. Typhilipedes most often hunt the lightless depths of Erebus for unwary souls and creatures of flesh. While capable of hunting on their own, typhilipedes usually hunt in teeming masses, swarming over whatever prey they encounter and devouring it. Despite the zeal with which they tear other creatures apart, typhilipedes prefer to consume the raw energy of light. This makes their presence convenient to the other inhabitants in the cavernous vaults of Erebus, where vast treasures lie cloaked in darkness like nothing known on the Material Plane. As the denizens of Erebus rarely have any need  for light-and suffer its presence with displeasure- typhilipedes can easily distinguish their prey, spotting even a candle's flicker from miles away and pursuing it relentlessly. One typhilipede spotting a source of light and winging toward it is often enough to set an entire swarm on the hunt.  Especially in secluded corners of the Darklands, where droves of typhilipedes occasionally flourish, these creatures are often known as \"eye biters.\" While the name might reference their tendency to plunge their victims into darkness before eating them, the nickname just as likely derives from the effects of the venom they produce. Survivors of typhilipede poison report feeling as though their eyes were on fire. Many also claim their experience with color changed dramatically as a result, with warm shades seeming to catch fire, becoming almost painfully vivid and certainly uncomfortable to look at. While these optical effects don't inhibit the victim's visual acuity, many survivors claim to be wary of bright lights and colors for weeks after shaking off the venom's effects.  While typhilipede venom is not usually deadly on its own, it is valued for its rarity. A single dose often sells for 1,500 gp or more in nefarious markets around the Inner Sea. Some Darklands alchemists believe that mixing typhilipede venom with the blood of good-aligned outsiders can make the poison much more debilitating-though the exact process by which this is possible remains elusive.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Beyond Erebus, typhilipedes are occasionally found in the Darklands realms of Orv and Sekamina, but they rarely venture closer to the surface than that. Given their ability to gain nourishment from light, many assume that typhilipedes flourish in areas of bright sunlight. In fact, overwhelming sources of bright light- especially sunlight-repel the creatures, forcing them into regions of absolute darkness.  Typhilipedes don't form communities or social bonds as more intelligent beings do. Instead, they tend to clump together, forming colonies akin to those of cockroaches. When hunting, they behave in a manner similar to a swarm, utilizing knowledge of the terrain to intercept prey and separate individuals from larger groups. Once they have surrounded a target, they attack en masse. Upon bringing down their prey, typhilipedes eat as a group. Typhilipede young and pregnant individuals eat first, as the hunters instinctively prioritize the groups' long-term survival over that of any individual. Hunters eat next, with the sickly and wounded eating last. Typically, typhilipedes that are debilitated in battle try to sacrifice themselves for the good of the group. Those that face excessive wounds but still survive, though, often try to slink away  into the darkness to quietly die. Few have the chance to indulge such a fate, though, as typhilipedes have an innate understanding of their own bodies and what they can survive. If no enemies are present and it becomes clear that one of their number bears a wound that will never heal, a typhilipede swarm quickly turns on the individual, enthusiastically cannibalizing it. Peculiarly, after consuming one of their own kind, typhilipedes typically stack the remains in a neat heap with the gnawed skull deliberately placed on top.  A typhilipede can be summoned as a familiar by a 7th-level spellcaster with an alignment up to one step away from lawful evil who has the Improved Familiar feat. Duergar spellcasters in particular favor typhilipede familiars, and many view possessing one-especially an overweight specimen-as a symbol of status.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Hells_Vengeance.jpg","_id":"e0qRN107NGo05dO3"}

A creature with at least 1 rank in Heal can use skin shed by a nehushtan to craft a draught that, when consumed, functions as either a potion of <i>remove disease</i> or a potion of <i>neutralize poison</i>, as chosen by the crafter.

This association may have its roots in nehushtans, a rare breed of bronze-colored serpents prized and venerated for their miraculous curative powers. Nehushtans' lustrous scales contain potent curative properties, making the snakes' shed skin extremely valuable to healers and apothecaries. In regions where nehushtans live, desperately sick or poor people sometimes turn to scavenging the hills, hoping to find the discarded, metallic skins in order to either use them or sell them.  Were it not for their peculiarly metallic scales, nehushtans would be virtually indistinguishable from vipers of comparable size. A nehushtan's body is 4 to 5 feet long, and it weighs 5 to 7 pounds.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  According to folklore, Sarenrae created the first nehushtan to answer the prayers of a priestess whose tribe was plagued by venomous serpents. The Dawnflower commanded her priestess to craft a bronze serpent and carry it among her people atop a large wooden pole. The visage of this \"nehushtan\" repelled mundane serpents, and those faithful who laid their hands upon the bronze idol found themselves miraculously cured of the vipers' venom. Once its holy work was done, Sarenrae rewarded the bronze idol for its service by imbuing it with the divine spark of life.  True or not, this story explains the nehushtans' antagonistic attitude toward other snakes. The creatures take great pleasure in hunting and killing venomous serpents, particularly when such creatures encroach on inhabited areas or endanger humanoid populations. Though a nehushtan usually consumes the snakes it kills, it attacks even serpents too large for it to swallow. Nehushtans' innate immunity to poison makes them extremely effective at hunting venomous creatures, and these make up a large part of their diet. Nehushtans are otherwise opportunistic carnivores, and feed on whatever small prey they can catch and swallow.  Nehushtans are venomous, and possess a potent venom that combusts when exposed to living flesh. Nehushtans use this toxin to painfully cook their prey from the inside out, and generally prefer to consume cooked or burnt flesh rather than raw meat. Nehushtans generally reserve this venom for their prey, and though they may bite to defend themselves or their young, they don't usually inject venom unless the target is particularly aggressive or persistent.  Nehushtans shed their skins two to four times a year, with younger nehushtans molting slightly more often. They shed throughout their lives, which are comparable  in length to a human's, and their skin grows increasingly powerful with each desquamation. Rare nehushtans live for hundreds of years, growing to incredible sizes and have skins that can cure any ailment. A nehushtan's discarded skin grows rigid after it is shed, resembling a mangled bronze leaf.  Popular folklore claims that nehushtans shed during certain times of the year, such as the month of Sarenith, but this is not true. Nehushtans can shed during any part of the year, with different individuals shedding at different times. Nonetheless, many hunters intensify their search efforts during the weeks preceding and following Sarenrae's holy days, hoping to gain favor from the goddess in the form of nehushtan skin.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  The temperaments of nehushtans vary. Some congregate in large extended families, while others associate with other nehushtans only long enough to breed and raise young. A nehushtan mother lays a clutch of two to four eggs, and both parents remain close to the nest until the young hatch. Unlike most serpents, nehushtans continue to care for their young after hatching, and stay with their children during the 2 to 3 months required for the young to fully mature into adults. During this time, the ordinarily peaceful creatures become fiercely protective, and most nehushtan bites are the result of unwary travelers stumbling too close to a nehushtan's nest when its young are present. Nehushtans prefer to dwell underground, taking over animal burrows or crawling into disused basements. They usually hunt in rocky environments.  Given the miraculous healing powers of their scales, many humanoids have tried to domesticate nehushtans. These attempts invariably meet with failure. Nehushtans languish if confined for more than a few days, and cannot survive more than a month in captivity no matter how comfortable their accommodations are. After this time, the miserable captives undergo a strange transformation-their scales grow dull and tarnished, and eventually the nehushtans loses their luster and turns into aggressive but otherwise mundane vipers. Some see this as a sign of Sarenrae's displeasure at mortals who would exploit her sacred gifts. Others suspect nehushtans require some unknown dietary or environmental factor that their captors can't provide.  Nehushtans who willingly choose to live among humanity suffer no ill effects. Entire families of the serpents sometimes establish colonies in human settlements, and thrive just as well as their wild counterparts, provided they are allowed to come and go as they  please and generally left to themselves. These colonies enjoy residing in hospitals, temples dedicated to healing, and other places where the sick and infirm dwell.  The presence of a nehushtan greatly enhances a patient's recovery and survival, and so mortals who operate infirmaries welcome these mystical serpents. Some healers even venerate nehushtans, and give offerings of milk and burnt meat to placate and honor the bronze serpents. In earlier days, hospitals that hosted nehushtans advertised this fact by incorporating bronze serpent motifs into their decorations. These symbols have long since become iconic for all houses of healing in the warm, dry regions from which nehushtans hail.  Nehushtans who choose to serve spellcasters as familiars likewise suffer no ill effects. They favor Sarenrae worshipers as masters, though any particularly devout or compassionate spellcaster can entice a nehushtan into service. Nehushtans adapt well to the adventurer's life, and particularly relish the opportunity to reduce the suffering of others by doing good works. Nehushtans are quick to abandon masters who grow cruel or merciless, and may even attack masters who radically shift in alignment. A good-aligned spellcaster of at least 7th level who takes the Improved Familiar feat can select a nehushtan as a familiar.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Hells_Vengeance.jpg","_id":"fSoXJsp00jn7nXbA"}

An ixion worm in its wheel form possesses the euphoric gaze, hypnotic wheel, and powerful charge special abilities. When in serpentine form, the ixion worm gains a 10-foot bonus to its speed, a climb speed of 10 feet, a +2 dodge bonus  to its Armor Class, and the constrict special attack. Changing between its forms is a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity, though an ixion worm in its wheel form that becomes prone may take on its serpentine form as a free action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity.  </p><p><strong>Energy Drain (Su)</strong> This ability functions as the universal monster rule of the same name, but rather than granting the ixion worm temporary hit points, it instead grants 1 additional use of its 3/day spell-like abilities per level drained. This additional use is available for 1 hour and is consumed only after the ixion worm's normal daily uses of its spell-like abilities have been expended.  </p><p><strong>Euphoric Gaze (Su)</strong> Three times a day as a move action, when in its wheel form, an ixion worm can unfocus its eye and spin it in a mesmerizing whirl to gain a gaze attack that affects all creatures within 30 feet as per <i>euphoric tranquility</i> (CL 14th, Will DC 22 partial). The effect is persistent but immediately ends if the ixion worm threatens or is threatened by a creature, uses any other special abilities, or moves in any way but a straight line. The effect also ends for creatures that move beyond the range of the gaze attack. While sustaining this effect, the ixion worm also takes a -8 penalty on visual Perception checks.  </p><p><strong>Hypnotic Wheel (Su)</strong> A rolling ixion worm's face is hypnotically grotesque. An ixion worm in wheel form can take a full-round action to move up to twice its speed. If it moves at least 20 feet as part of such an action, it can target a creature within 30 feet that is visible from any square in its path with a 14th-level mesmerist's hypnotic stare (Pathfinder RPG <i>Occult</i> Adventures 39) that has the allure, susceptibility, and timidity bold stare improvements (<i>Occult</i> Adventures 42). The stare's effects last until the start of the ixion worm's next turn, regardless of the ixion worm's location. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Ixion worms are both literal and figurative cogs in Phlegethon's workings. Each is forged of flesh stretched over massive bones, and each bears the identical face of a hypnotically entrancing male cyclops. Its bones can slither as a crooked serpent or join at the ends to form a wheel, with its face freely sliding around the structure to spin on one side of the hub as it rolls itself around. The rotation amplifies the ixion worm's hypnotic abilities, which it uses to motivate Phlegethon's petitioners into working harder in the layer's mines and forges.  The ixion worm's mouth dribbles with a prismatic oily residue that corrodes and absorbs the souls of whatever creatures with which it mingles. The worm's size and mass-5 feet wide, 9 feet in radius in wheel form, nearly 30 feet long unrolled, and 600 pounds in weight- also make the creature a terrifying physical force as it careens down the narrow paths of Phlegethon's crags.  The ixion worm's entrancing gaze and mental powers, however, are what make it an effective and intimidating enforcer; few of Phlegethon's lesser inhabitants consider challenging what they quickly believe is their only friend in Hell.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  When petitioners slack in their work, an ixion worm snakes into place, forms a wheel, and lulls them into a trance by rolling in hypnotic patterns until the rocky layer of Hell seems to become a twisted fantasy: a rolling field of rotting food to the gluttonous, for instance, or an endless sea of writhing, formless flesh to the lustful. The few who dare to disobey are either smashed under the wheel's rim or suckled in its warped mouth, where its soul-draining spit strips away what little individuality and vitality a creature retains.  Belial smiles upon ixion worms that excel at their tasks and promotes them to serve as pulley wheels in his forges' machinery. The most prized are sent to Dispater to become gears in Dis's gates and wheels in the groaning carts that carry piles of petitioners through the layers of Hell. These elevated ixion worms endlessly plead for devils and broken souls alike to show gratitude to their diabolic benefactors, lest they too become little more than implements of Hell.  In ancient tales passed down by the duergar of Nar-Voth, a handful of elevated ixion worms escaped Hell and taught the duergar the secrets of Phlegethon's forges in a daring double-crossing of the lord of betrayal himself. The duergar venerate the ixion worms in these stories with the hope that they'll one day return to the Darklands bearing new infernal secrets of binding souls to stone and metal.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Crafted from the souls of those who betray their relatives, ixion worms are all built from a singular namesake template- the ancient cyclops mesmerist Ixion, who psychically cowed a tribe of cyclopes under his rule during the nascent days of the kingdom of Ghol-Gan.  In his covetous lust for his mother-in-law, the self-styled King Ixion lured his own father to death in a spiked pit trap. His flagrant betrayal garnered the attention of Belial, archdevil of Phlegethon and master of betrayers, and the archdevil dispatched an agent to Ixion's wife and mother-in-law to expose the king's plot and tempt them into killing him for vengeance. Belial's ploy worked; the women stabbed Ixion into submission, strapped his body  to an oxcart's wheel, and then plowed him through his kingdom's mud until he died.  When the cyclops's soul reached Belial's pleasure palace of Idolisque, the archdevil presented Ixion with a choice: to serve in the forges or join his twisted harem. Ixion spitefully responded by expressing his distaste for Belial's palace and declaring the archdevil's finest souls far too ugly. In a fit of mirthful wrath, the archdevil ripped the former king's soul apart and had him reforged into a worm of bones. Devils stretched Ixion's comely face across its length, then rolled his new form into the shape of a wheel.  The ever-defiant mesmerist king nonetheless tried to hypnotize Belial into admitting his poor taste, and the archdevil rewarded his persistence by tossing him from Idolisque and into the jagged rocks below. To further mock Ixion, who still searches Phlegethon in anonymous bitterness for the souls of his wife and mother-in-law, Belial commanded his forges to craft the souls of every familial betrayer sent to Phlegethon into the cyclops king's likeness.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Hells_Vengeance.jpg","_id":"imO4op1qYYNp7Gof"}

These animalistic collections of bones typically form from the remains of numerous animals that died in terrible agony. The dark forces and suffering that animates these remains typically cause these horrors to form in ominous, multilimbed shapes vaguely reminiscent of macabre centipedes. Although they look merely like heaps of bones when at rest, they can hardly be mistaken as such when on the move. Centianimas are possessed of  a dark, predatory cunning that makes them particularly efficient hunters.  A centianima measures 12 feet long and weighs approximately 400 pounds.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  The flexible body of a centianima consists of 15 or more leg-bearing segments made from fused-together bones. Centianimas require no sustenance, but they sometimes carry their dead or unconscious victims back to their lairs in their hollow interiors. Their pointy-tipped legs are exceptionally flexible, allowing them to rapidly change the direction of their movement or even skitter sideways in an undulating motion. Each of a centianima's two heads consists of one or more animal skulls fused together and sports a pair of long, jointed antennae. Their eye sockets each bear a dark violet necromantic membrane that functions much like the eyes of a spider.  Centianimas sometimes form spontaneously in places where animals have died in great numbers and no one has buried, burned, or eaten the bones, such as abandoned slaughterhouses and the charnel pits of greater monsters. When a centianima's body starts forming, it first develops a skeletal segment and grows a pair of twitching legs. This process repeats until the body has at least 15 segments. The final stage of this horrible genesis involves forming a head segment on each end. The heads do not form simultaneously, however, and for a brief period, the centianima has only one head.  As undead creatures, centianimas do not need rest and thus remain active day and night. However, their behavior changes markedly with the time of the day. At night, they hunt vertebrates of all sizes, from mice to horses. During the day, they skitter over the bodies they have captured, skinning them and stripping them of flesh. A centianimas's daytime activities also include patrolling its lair and environs, organizing its bone collection, and moving loose rocks to places where they might hinder intruders but not the centianima itself. Centianimas that live underground exhibit similar behaviors, though they adapt their daily cycles to hunt when prey is most vulnerable, regardless of the time of the day.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Centianimas usually inhabit ruined buildings where there are many places to hide. They are excellent climbers and, thanks to their flexible exoskeletons, they can crawl through very narrow spaces. They use these abilities to great effect against invaders, ambushing unwelcome visitors in places where less agile beings are at a disadvantage.  The lair of a centianima usually contains one or more piles of bones collected from its victims. The bones may be meticulously organized according to animal or bone type, or they may be a disorganized mess. Somewhere in  the lair, usually a good distance from the bone piles, there is also a rotting mound of discarded flesh, skin, tendon, and other soft tissue.  Centianimas are solitary and territorial, and when one encounters boneless creatures, other undead monsters, or anything that looks too dangerous to attack, it emits an unpleasant chitter that sounds like grinding teeth. If the sound is not enough to warn the intruders away, the centianima attacks or retreats depending on the size and number of the intruders.  The rotting mounds of flesh usually present in a centianima's lair attract all kinds of vermin, and it is not uncommon for swarms of cockroaches, spiders, centipedes, or flesh-eating worms to share a centianima's lair. The undead creature largely ignores these vermin because they neither have bones nor pose a threat.  <br /><strong>Creating a Centianima  Centianimas</strong><br /> are often created by wicked spellcasters who either seek a free-roaming guardian to defend an area or have a grudge against nature. A centianima can be produced through the use of the spell <i>create undead</i> by any caster of 13th-level or higher. However, rather than casting the spell on one corpse, the creator must cast it on a heap of bones comprising the skeletons of no fewer than three Medium or Large animals. Smaller skeletons can be used, but at least double the number is required.  Upon being created, an uncontrolled centianima searches the surrounding area for a lair. After finding a suitable dark, preferably claustrophobic space, the creature begins hunting in a territory within a 1 mile radius of its lair. In a region with an average amount of wildlife, it takes little more than 2 weeks for a centianima to fill its lair with a dense carpet of bones.  <br /><strong>Centianima Variants</strong><br /> The circumstances under which a centianima forms greatly affect its abilities. The following are the most common variants.  <br /><strong>Aquatic (CR +0):</strong> These centianimas arise from the bones of aquatic animals. They usually inhabit sunken ships and ruins claimed by the sea. Aquatic centianimas gain the aquatic subtype and a swim speed of 40 feet.  <br /><strong>Burrowing (CR +0):</strong> This underground variant usually arises from the dry bones of many burrowing creatures. Burrowing centianimas gain a burrow speed of 20 feet.  <br /><strong>Chittering (CR +1):</strong> This variant centianima can emit a bone-rattling  chitter as a standard action. Any creature within 30 feet must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save or be shaken for 1d4+1 rounds. Any creature that makes a successful save against the effect is immune to that centianima's chitter for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.  <br /><strong>Jumping (CR +0):</strong> This desert-dwelling variant gains a +12 racial bonus on Acrobatics checks to jump and it treats any Acrobatics skill check to jump, as if it had a running start. It doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity while jumping. A jumping centianima uses this ability to position itself amid its enemies so it can better attack with both of its heads.  <br /><strong>One-Headed (CR -1):</strong> This rare variant occurs when the formation of a centianima is interrupted before the second head has formed. One-headed centianimas have only 3 Hit Dice, and they don't gain all-around vision or the dual threat special ability.  <br /><strong>Paralytic (CR +1):</strong> These centianimas arise from the bones of venomous animals. Any creature that takes damage from the centianima's bite attack must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save or be paralyzed for 1d4+1 rounds. The save DC is Charisma-based.  <br /><strong>Symbiotic (CR +1):</strong> These centianimas have formed a close symbiotic relationship with the vermin that feed on the rotting flesh in their lairs. Three times per day, the centianima can vomit up a spider swarm (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</i> 258) as a standard action. This swarm attacks the nearest living creature, but is otherwise not controlled by the centianima.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Hells_Vengeance.jpg","_id":"n5qHLQK3eME6v1d9"}

A typical xiuh couatl is 20 feet long with a wingspan of 25 feet. It weighs 4,500 pounds.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Unlike their cousins, the common quetz couatl (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</i> 49) and the roving auwaz couatl, xiuh couatls are rarely seen, but are a sight to behold when they make themselves known. The beat of each wing is a brilliant display of terrifying flames and magnificent flashes of lightning that send cacophonous echoes through the sky. The couatls' flight can be heard up to a mile away. As they move through the air, they resemble thunderstorms with flaming rain. These fiery tempests are said to be omens signaling the imminent fall of wickedness or a forthcoming new beginning, born of a purifying inferno.  A xiuh couatl's snout glows red hot for minutes after spewing forth its elemental breath. This breath, like the xiuh couatl's wings, is a coalescence of fire and electricity-a fearsome ray of powerful energy. The breath is used not only to attack enemies, but also to burn away decayed or corrupted lands with cleansing flame.  The couatl's tail ends in a small conflagration that moves and flickers in response to the couatl's moods.  The mind of a xiuh couatl is powerful and wise, bordering on the transcendent. It uses its extraordinary psychic gifts to track down evil foes, making use of its ability to see into possible futures to quickly find its targets. Once it locates a creature, the xiuh couatl sends portents to the target's <i>dream</i>s to dissuade it from a life of evil. If these <i>vision</i>s are not enough, a xiuh couatl visits the creature and offers to share its knowledge of goodness and virtue. The xiuh couatl shows the creature the differences in its life if it continues on a path of evildoing and if it accepts redemption. If these steps fail, the xiuh couatl destroys the creature's body or its mind, whichever is found to be a more fitting punishment, as a last resort.  Xiuh couatls are extremely long-lived, with some said to have been alive before Earthfall. During its lifetime, a female xiuh couatl lays only a single egg. The egg is as black as ash and hatches anywhere from a single couatl to a litter of eight to 10. As native outsiders, xiuh couatls must eat, and they are known to feed on large wildlife such as bison, deer, or wild horses. Occasionally, they consume larger creatures that pose threats to local civilizations or environments, such as rocs or young dragons.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Unlike their more common cousins, xiuh couatls are seen only during the gravest of times. When not actively seeking foul creatures to redeem, they nest in dangerous, remote places where they are likely to be undisturbed. Volcanic calderas, remote valleys, and high mountaintops wrapped in continual lightning storms are notable locations where xiuh couatl nests have been found. For years after they have been abandoned, the nests are known for their tendency to attract fire and lightning elementals. Xiuh couatls and their nests are extremely rare in Avistan, but are more frequently found in central and southern Garund and the mountains of central Arcadia.  While solitary creatures, xiuh couatls occasionally form a close bond with a partner with whom they may even mate (should they have not done so previously in their long lifetimes). The closest of these relationships are forged between a couatl and one of the offspring born from its sole egg. While a parent cannot mate again, such a bond is universally platonic and can span centuries, far longer than most similar pairings. While a partnership may last as long as a millennia, nearly all xiuh couatls eventually return to lives of solitude. They can acquire many allies during a crusade for good, but move on as soon as they have vanquished a particular evil.</p><p>Though they tend to rely on their own <i>vision</i>s and <i>divination</i>s to seek out evil, xiuh couatls are sometimes called on by the gods to tackle given tasks. Sarenrae, in particular, makes the most of use of all types of couatls, but xiuh couatls can be called upon by Desna, Shelyn, or, in Arcadia, Kazutal, goddess of community, liberty, and safety. As usual, xiuh couatls first attempt to redeem the creatures they are tasked with destroying, but follow with violent retribution if required. Gods may also assign xiuh couatls to aid individuals who require assistance in times of adversity. These individuals are gifted weapons by their divine patrons, and may never know they actually wield xiuh couatls, even after their tasks have been completed.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Hells_Vengeance.jpg","_id":"nlGXrPaUbvNe0L6l"}

As a full-round action, it can  unravel the scarlet thread from around its horns, allowing the thread to be grasped by up to 8 Medium or Small creatures (or 4 Large creatures or 16 Tiny creatures). Once the participants have all grasped the woolen strand, the ez-azael flings itself from the precipice to its death as a move action while the participants continue to hang on to the thread. The fall is always fatal to the ez-azael, and it cannot be saved by any means, magical or mundane. As the ez-azael falls, the thread breaks and the portion remaining in the participants' hands changes from scarlet to pure white. Those participants of a nonevil alignment who are holding the thread immediately receive the benefits of an <i>atonement</i>, a <i>greater restoration</i>, and a <i>bless</i> spell (with a duration of 24 hours).  As an additional benefit of the <i>atonement</i> ritual, if the participants who grasp the thread are officially appointed representatives of a specific population (such as city leaders, high priests, heads of families, etc.), all members of the group they represent within a quarter mile of where the ritual occurs receive the above benefits.  The effects granted by an ez-azael through this ritual never requires an expenditure of incense or other monetary offerings. The sacrifice of the ez-azael itself satisfies any such requirements.  </p><p><strong>Sacrificial Wound (Su)</strong> Once per day as an immediate action, an ez-azael can convert hit point damage it takes from any single attack into a boost for its allies. The ez-azael takes the full amount of damage (even if such damage would kill the ez-azael), but any allies within 60 feet receive a number of temporary hit points equal to half of the amount of damage the ez-azael sustained (rounded down). These temporary hit points last for 1 hour. The number of temporary hit points a recipient gains through the use of this ability can't exceed double its normal maximum hit points.  </p><p><strong>Smiting Absolution (Su)</strong> As a standard action once every 1d4 rounds, an ez-azael can cause its golden eyes to flash with an almost blinding <i>light</i> that affects all evil creatures within a 40-foot radius centered on the ez-azael. The purifying rays of this <i>light</i> affect evil creatures differently according to their alignments if they fail a DC 23 Will saving throw. Chaotic evil creatures that fail the save are paralyzed for 1d10 rounds, neutral evil creatures are stunned for 1d4 rounds, and lawful evil creatures are confused for 1d4 rounds. Sinspawn (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2</i> 246) are destroyed on a failed save. The save DC is Charisma-based with a +2 bonus from Ability Focus.  </p><p><strong>True Resurrection (Su)</strong> An ez-azael can, as a standard action, give up its own life in order to cast a <i>true resurrection</i> spell on one target of its choice. Alternately, an ez-azael can use this ability to cast <i>destruction</i> on one evil target within 60 feet. This use of the spell deals 160 points of damage to the target unless it succeeds at a DC 22 Fortitude saving throw, in which case it deals only  10d6 points of damage. In either use of this ability, the ez-azael is utterly destroyed, having fulfilled its purpose for existence. The save DC is Wisdom-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>The ways of Heaven are often unknown or opaque in purpose and meaning to mortals, and the ritual of the ez-azael is no exception. In the eternal battle between the powers of good and evil, powerful angelic beings occasionally capture a type of goat-like demon called a schir (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 3</i> 74) and subject it to a powerful cleansing ritual in which it is used as an offering of <i>atonement</i> for some mortal population to relieve them of both the physical and spiritual burdens of their sins or other acts of moral error they have committed. Upon the ritual's completion, the mortal population receives absolution and the schir is released to wander free with its new burden of forgiven mortal sin. Almost invariably, these demons die from the trauma of being used as a vessel for divine mercy. However, sometimes the ritual of clemency changes the schir in a fundamental way, in which case it transforms into an ez-azael.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  An ez-azael is a rare creature occasionally created from a specific type of demon through a redemptive ritual conducted by powerful celestial beings. Though of extraplanar origin, its new existence is bound to the pardon of mortal sins, which creates a strong affinity to the mortal world. An ez-azael is always found on the Material Plane and has the native subtype. As a being formed of mortal <i>atonement</i>, an ez-azael's reason for existence is to continue this role and use its special status to further free goodly mortals from their bondage to iniquity-especially the bonds imposed on them through the manipulation or temptations of evil outsiders. An ez-azael lives to die in this endeavor and has no qualms about doing so.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  An ez-azael wanders desolate areas where it can have the most impact on a needful mortal individual or community. It always travels alone, and it is entirely possible that only one ez-azael exists at a time, and that when it is slain, it simply reincarnates after another schir is ritually cleansed. The very existence of an ez-azael is anathema to demons, and the presence of one of these celestial creatures draws an ever-escalating series of attacks when demons become aware of its presence in a region. An ez-azael knows its days are numbered and always seeks to find mortals in need of redemption in the limited time it has.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Hells_Vengeance.jpg","_id":"oGB63iPDT4YRbxB7"}

As a swift action, the kuribu can present a different countenance and gain its benefits, losing the benefits of the countenance the angel has just hidden.  <i>Eagle</i>: The kuribu's face and voice become more birdlike. Once every 1d4 rounds, the kuribu can let out an ear-piercing screech as a standard action. All creatures in a 15-foot cone take 1d6 points of sonic damage (Fortitude DC 13 half). Creatures with  4 Hit Dice or fewer that fail their saving throws are dazed for 1 round. The save DC is Constitution-based.  <i>Human</i>: The kuribu's face becomes like a mask, and the angel gains the freeze extraordinary ability, allowing the kuribu to take 20 on Stealth checks to hide in plain sight as a marble statue of a kuribu. The kuribu can appear as a statue indefinitely. Most kuribus first present this face when dealing with mortals, changing to one of their other faces only if combat begins.  <i>Lion</i>: The kuribu develops a fearsome set of jaws capable of making bite attacks. This is a primary natural attack (with a +5 attack bonus) that deals 1d4 points of damage.  <i>Ox</i>: The kuribu's face grows sterner and body grows sturdier. The angel gains a +4 <i>resistance</i> bonus on Fortitude saving throws and a +4 to CMD against bull rush and trip combat maneuvers.  </p><p><strong>Lesser Protective Aura (Su)</strong> A kuribu has a lesser form of the protective aura possessed by more powerful angels. This protective aura grants the kuribu a +2 deflection bonus to AC against evil foes, and a +2 <i>resistance</i> bonus on all saving throws made against evil effects or spells cast by evil creatures (this does not stack with the <i>resistance</i> bonus from the kuribu's ox countenance). This aura extends to a radius of 5 feet, but can benefit only two additional creatures other than the kuribu at any one time. A kuribu's protective aura is fragile, and as soon as an evil creature successfully strikes the angel, or as soon as the kuribu fails a saving throw against an evil source, the protective aura fades away and is no longer applicable. The kuribu can reactivate the protective aura by spending 1 minute concentrating upon the task.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Though one of the least powerful kinds of angels, kuribus are trusted with the protection of sacred places such as churches and <i>bless</i>ed bowers. Their ability to stay as still as statues allows them to stand sentinel over their charges for decades, or even centuries. When their guarded locations are invaded, kuribus take flight and pepper their foes with arrows, altering their countenances as the situation requires. If outmatched or outnumbered, the majority of a flight of kuribus sacrifice themselves, while a lone kuribu retreats to fetch reinforcements, be it angels from a higher choir or a nearby hero.  Kuribus look like small, round-cheeked humanoids, and have pale, flawless skin that is actually as tough as stone. This both aids them in disguising themselves as statues and affords  them protection. Their child-like forms lend them an air of purity and innocence. A kuribu has two sets of wings, with the smaller pair at the base of the spine allowing a greater amount of control when flying. A typical kuribu stands 3 feet tall but weighs 60 pounds as a result of the angel's dense, stonelike flesh.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Kuribus are fashioned from the souls of good mortals who died protecting a treasured place or ideal. As these spirits traverse the River of Souls, they undergo several metamorphoses, gaining the qualities that eventually become their <i>bless</i>ed aspects. The majority of kuribus can take on the countenances of eagles, lions, and oxen, but a few variant kuribus possessing the aspects of different animals do exist. However, all kuribus can blend in with the architecture of a church, appearing as innocent-looking statues with wide eyes and plump cheeks.  Kuribus have a remarkable amount of patience and tolerance for boredom, as they may be assigned to watch over particular locations for years. Mortal generations pass swiftly for kuribus, with years blurring in much the same way days might for mortals. However, their senses are always alert, and the s<i>light</i>est destructive act against their charges can cause them to spring into action. While this self-defensiveness certainly extends to vandals and evil beasts, kuribus have boundless patience for the birds and small mammals that sometimes make homes upon their bodies or shelter beneath their wings. While kuribus would never let a terrible crime transpire before their eyes just to protect a pigeon's comfort, there have been instances of these angels revealing themselves only after their avian residents have migrated away for the season. This has more to do with kuribus' otherworldly sense of urgency and time than any particular affinity for animals.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  As kuribus protect sacred areas, they are witness to, but rarely interact with, many different types of good-aligned outsiders. Unless these outsiders seek to cause harm, the kuribus see no reason to interrupt them on their business. As such, other angels tend to consider kuribus to be more decoration than fellow animate beings. Kuribus think nothing of this prejudice, as they are confident in the importance of their duties.  Occasionally, an angel important enough to employ a flight of kuribus to safeguard their own sanctum will develop a certain fondness for the smaller outsiders. The overseer angel speaks pleasantly with the kuribus, keeping them informed of the important events of the Outer Sphere, not expecting responses. In turn, the kuribus grow fiercely loyal to the more powerful angel. Eventually, this relationship blossoms into something more familial and playful, the kuribus trying to move from their positions without the other angel noticing  In times of crisis, however, this whimsy is immediately dropped in favor of the defense of the holy sanctum.  On the other hand, kuribus rarely form close relationships with other kuribus. When part of a flight that protects a single location, kuribus work together well, but solely as professional associates and nothing more. If, for some reason, a single kuribu has different ideas than the rest of the flight about the best way to defend their charge, that angel quickly falls in line with the others. Kuribus hold their duties above their pride.  In rare cases, kuribus might find themselves lingering in areas that were once holy but have been abandoned or despoiled. In such cases, a kuribu often stoically waits for goodly folk to return, whether as a congregation restoring the site or heroes who might help cast out a lingering evil.  <strong><br />Calling a Kuribu</strong><br />  The payment requested by a kuribu called with <i>lesser planar ally</i> is often a donation that helps to rebuild or refurbish a church or other holy site. As a kuribu considers these places to be very important to the appropriate deity, the angel will halve any payment required if asked to guard such a location. A few kuribus even accept long-term, open-ended requests to protect a piece of sacred ground from a worthy caller. A small number of cathedrals on the Material Plane are home to kuribus selected for such a service decades ago, and whose original callers have long since passed away.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Hells_Vengeance.jpg","_id":"pK4Pbpz5BZTzP5ZV"}

Three times per day as a standard action, a merlucent can replicate the effects of a single arcane spell cast within 20 feet of it, directing the spell's effect and choosing a target as if it were the caster. This echo uses the merlucent's caster level rather than that of the original spellcaster, and a merlucent can't echo any effect with a spell level greater than half the merlucent's own Hit Dice (generally limiting it to second-level spells).

The polyp begins slowly consuming its host's brain, transforming the creature's flesh into a transparent jelly and replacing its bone with delicate crystal. A creature that takes any amount of Intelligence damage from a merlucent polyp can breathe while underwater, but loses the ability to breathe air. If a humanoid creature takes ability damage in excess of its Intelligence score, it transforms into a new merlucent, losing all abilities or class levels it previously possessed. The polyp can be destroyed by any effect that removes disease, but the inability to breathe air persists until a creature's Intelligence damage is healed.  <i>Vitrify</i>: Implantation; save Fort 12; <i>onset</i> 12 hours; frequency 1/day; effect 1d4 Int damage; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Merlucents are strange creatures formed from the fusion of human and jellyfish. As a species, they are simple-minded ascetics. Individual clans claim small stretches of coastline where they hunt fish and shellfish, and scratch strange glyphs into coral, coaxing it to grow in unnatural though beautiful formations. Naturally sensitive to arcane energy, they settle in locations rife with ambient magic, such as along ley lines or near schools of magic built on islands or coasts. Local communities generally consider merlucents to be pests for stripping fishing grounds bare, but the aberrations also keep more aggressive aquatic threats away. This small blessing turns bane every 2 to 5 years when merlucents enter their mating phase and become extremely aggressive.  To reproduce, each merlucent spawns dozens of ant-sized polyps, each of which must mature inside the skull of a humanoid host. Depending on the host, it can take anywhere from days to weeks for the tiny parasite to take over its host's mind and convert the bony, flesh-covered body into its own adult form. To support their children, merlucents conduct fanatical crusades, kidnapping surface dwellers to act as incubators. Relying on its members' stealth and paralytic poison, a single clan may snatch dozens of unwary sailors or coastal residents in a single season.  Merlucents range from 4 to 5 feet in height and weigh around 180 pounds, though smaller or larger specimens may be spawned depending on the size of the host.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  A merlucent's natural ability to sniff out and reproduce arcane magic-as well as its dependence on humanoids to reproduce-is suggestive of unnatural origins, though none of Golarion's usual culprits known for creating grotesque hybrids have ever been associated with the jellyfish-folk. Merlucents prefer kidnapping arcane spellcasters to host their young, even though they can spawn in any humanoid and their young rarely inherit a host's spellcasting ability. They also show little interest in the flavor of magic their targets wield. Merlucents were likely an accidental creation, spawned at some unknown point in the past-a grim reminder that magic remains a powerful force beyond any creature's complete control, and its use may produce unexpected consequences.  Merlucents are carnivores, eating fish, shellfish, and the occasional seabird-with their translucent skin exposing the digestive process for any to see. They have no need for sleep; instead, they tend to drift with the currents, waiting for small fish to swim into their tentacles. They can wait weeks between meals, and ride the tides for hundreds of miles in a state of torpor. However, they can also become ravenous and deplete entire coves in a matter of days.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Merlucents have little in the way of religion or philosophy, and focus primarily on eating and creating art until the mating frenzy consumes them. Long-established colonies may shape coral reefs into elaborate cave systems over generations, complete with air pockets where they keep captives until the colony is ready to implant them with polyps. While merlucents understand other humanoids to be intelligent, they see them as alien and needlessly complex- more akin to termites than neighbors. On rare occasions, merlucents trade with surface dwellers, offering fish, reconnaissance, and scavenged goods in exchange for magic baubles. They rarely use these acquired treasures, instead working them into their ever-expanding coral formations. Merlucents can eventually come to see long-time surface neighbors as beloved pets or a private herd, and show affection by nurturing barnacles to grow on docks and boats to keep the waters clean, or dragging the bloated carcasses of large sea animals to shore for their pets to eat.  To merlucents' alien senses, magical auras twinkle like soft music or pleasant <i>light</i>s. They treasure potions or wands as humans might treasure music boxes or other delicate trinkets, and they see arcane spellcasters as itinerant performers. Thanks to merlucents' fascination with magic, several clans may follow or worship particularly powerful aquatic wizards  and sorcerers, but such aggregations rarely outlast the group's leader.  After a merlucent rears an indeterminate number of young, a strange new instinct takes over its mind, calling it down into the deepest ocean trenches. These elders form large colonies-sometimes a hundred strong-around thermal vents on the ocean floor. Here, they rear massive schools of jellyfish and cultivate farms of tube worms in vast, swirling formations. Elder merlucents show little interest in eating their livestock, but aggressively defend their colonies against intruders. They become especially aggressive toward deep merfolk, with whom they fight constantly for control of the richest vents. Rather than implanting their young into captive merfolk, merlucents instead hurl their unfortunate enemies into the sea floor's boiling fissures, cooking them alive.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Hells_Vengeance.jpg","_id":"qXO43Slqs1bFA6Pz"}

These attacks  are treated as a pair of <i>+4 spiked gauntlets</i>. At will as a standard action, a ninkonda can grant these attacks the <i>axiomatic</i>, <i>holy</i>, or <i>merciful</i> weapon special ability, but must select the same special ability for both hands. Their hands retain the selected special ability until they choose another special ability to replace the previous one. These weapons cannot be removed or sundered. They fade away when the ninkonda dies and cannot be used by any other creature. As a standard action, a ninkonda can fling a volley of four spikes from their arms. Make a separate attack roll for each spike-all targets must be within 30 feet of each other. The spikes have a range increment of 20 feet. The spikes are treated as <i>+4 darts</i> with the same weapon special ability as the ninkonda's fists.

Each round as a swift action, the ninkonda can project a 60-foot cone of contrition. All creatures in the cone fall prone with grief and remorse, taking no actions for as long as they are within 60 feet of the ninkonda (Will DC 25 negates). A lawful creature gains a +4 bonus on this saving throw, and a good creature gains a +8 bonus on the saving throw (these bonuses stack). Sightless creatures cannot be affected by this ability, nor can creatures that cast no reflection (such as vampires). This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Ninkondas, or \"nail angels,\" are stoic, remorseless hunters of the celestial planes. At a distance, a ninkonda appears to be a winged knight wearing full plate armor. Up close, the creatures present a more intimidating and bizarre appearance: dozens of iron spikes impale their arms, shoulders, and hands, and the faceplates of their helms are smooth and featureless. Ninkondas hunt once-honorable mortals who have committed heinous sins, such as treason against good nations or betrayal of celestial confidences. Ninkondas don't slay their quarry; instead they wordlessly encourage redemption by reflecting the creature's soul in the mirror inset in the angels' broad chests.  Ninkondas stand 12 feet tall with wingspans of just over 25 feet. They weigh about 1,200 pounds.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Although ninkondas resemble stout, armored humanoids with feathered golden wings, the armor is the creatures' thick skin and their cumbersome appearances bely their  natural grace. Ninkondas have no faces; a blank helm topped with a golden crown sits atop each ninkonda's thick neck. Despite lacking facial features, ninkondas have supernaturally sharp senses and can speak in a deep, somber voice (although they rarely choose to do so). Ninkondas are good at recognizing truth and find dishonesty particularly repugnant.  The iron spikes that impale ninkondas' arms and shoulders are physical manifestations of their past misdeeds. These spikes cause ninkondas a constant dull ache rather than a sharp pain, but ninkondas embrace this discomfort as an ever-present reminder of how wickedness can be overcome. The reflection in the broad mirror across a ninkonda's chest is always hazy and inexact, as it shows spiritual truth rather than physical reality.  Ninkondas watch for evidence of wicked mortals who might harbor a spark of goodness within them. A ninkonda who identifies a candidate for redemption pursues this quarry tirelessly, dispatching the mortal's irredeemable lackeys (such as undead and fiends) with nail-studded fists and confronting the mortal personally. In the ninkonda's broad chest-mirror, the quarry sees not only the stains on its own soul but the repercussions of all its past transgressions. For those who are truly repentant when confronted so directly with their wickedness, the ninkonda offers <i>atonement</i> and helps them back onto the path leading a righteous life.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Ninkondas are few in number. Though they originate from the ranks of archons, only the most erudite scholars of Heaven can describe how ninkondas come into existence. Many archons begin as virtuous mortal spirits who are transformed into lantern archons or other lesser servitors, then ascend predictably through the hierarchy of Heaven. Some of these virtuous spirits, however, have not always been so: some lived mortal lives of startling wickedness before repenting of their evil ways and joining the ranks of Heaven. Although the archons do not fault each other for mortal wrongs, a rare few archons dwell on their own dimly remembered misdeeds. These transgressions vex their thoughts like splinters. Eventually, some of these archons decide that redeeming other mortal wrongdoers is a higher calling than the service of Heaven's hierarchies; when such archons advance, they slip from the usual ranks and are reborn as ninkondas  Their mortal misconduct takes physical form in the spikes that pierce their flesh.  Ninkondas prefer to work alone, but form small squads against groups that fell into wickedness together (such as a band of desperate revolutionaries or a couple of accidental murderers). The ninkondas hope to redeem all the members of such groups together, so that they can find strength and courage in each other's company once the ninkondas have gone.

This is a sonic mind-affecting fear effect. Good or neutral creatures are unaffected by the howl as long as they are not there to attack Valor's Fastness or steal from the dead interred there. Whether or not the save is successful, a creature cannot be affected by Exemplar's howl again for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Know Alignment (Su)</strong> Exemplar automatically knows the alignment of any creature that enters Valor's Fastness. This ability can be suppressed, but Exemplar can reactivate it the following round as a free action. This ability cannot be extended beyond the limits of Exemplar's domain.  </p><p><strong>Limited Domain (Ex)</strong> Exemplar is sworn to protect the grounds of Valor's Fastness. He can freely wander through the courtyard and first floor of the temple (areas h4 through H13), but he cannot move beyond these boundaries.  </p><p><strong>Rejuvenation (Su)</strong> Exemplar cannot be destroyed through simple combat. If slain, Exemplar restores himself in 24 hours, reappearing in Valor's Fastness. The only way to permanently destroy Exemplar is to raze Valor's Fastness to the ground and cast <i>desecrate</i> or <i>unhallow</i> on the fountain in the church's courtyard (area h4).  </p><p><strong>Soul Defender (Su)</strong> Exemplar's sacred duty is to defend the bodies and souls of those buried within Valor's Fastness. Any attempts to cast <i>animate dead</i> or similar spells to create undead within Exemplar's domain require the caster to succeed at a DC 20 caster level check. If the check fails, the spell fizzles away just as if it had been cast.  </p><p><strong>Wisdom Damage (Su)</strong> Exemplar's incorporeal bite deals 1d8 points of damage and 1d4 points of Wisdom damage to a target. A successful DC 16 Fortitude save negates the Wisdom damage. On each successful attack that deals Wisdom damage, Exemplar gains 5 temporary hit points. The save DC is Constitution-based.</p></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Hells_Vengeance.jpg","_id":"uCYc1tUfaHoFnRXf"}

Howler-cougar hybrids were smaller than either parent, and this allowed easy hybridization with smaller, long-haired breeds of cats that increased quill length and decreased the animal's size. A healthy young quillcat is worth 175 gp.  The spines normally lie flat against the quillcat's body, but when the creature is scared or surprised, they stand erect on its tail and back, nearly doubling the cat's apparent size. Instead of typical feline vocalizations, quillcats communicate by howling and yapping. Quillcats hate hell-bred dogs and fearlessly attack the larger creatures on sight.  Quillcats are 3 feet long and weigh 60 pounds.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Hells_Vengeance.jpg","_id":"uWBaYxKMJG5FYeaH"}

They deal 2d8 points of lethal bludgeoning damage, though the mustelidal can choose to deal nonlethal damage instead with no penalty on his attack roll. The mustelidal applies his full Strength modifier on all damage rolls with his unarmed strike. A mustelidal's unarmed strike is treated as both a manufactured weapon and  a natural weapon for the purpose of spells and effects that modify either manufactured weapons or natural weapons. A mustelidal's unarmed strikes are treated as magic, cold iron, silver, and adamantine weapons for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction and bypassing hardness.  </p><p><strong>Poison Purge (Su)</strong> As a full-round action, a mustelidal who has been poisoned can will himself into an unconscious state for 10 minutes. During this time, the mustelidal suffers no further effects from the poison, and cannot be roused from this deathlike trance by any means. At the end of the 10 minutes, the mustelidal awakens completely cured of any poisons that were affecting him. This doesn't heal the mustelidal of any existing ability damage or drain the poison may have already caused. If the mustelidal succumbs to a poison that causes unconsciousness, this ability triggers automatically.  </p><p><strong>Reckless Bravura (Ex)</strong> As a swift action when a mustelidal is flanked or within the area threated by a creature whose size is at least Huge, the mustelidal can enter a frenzy, taking a -2 penalty to his AC and gaining a +2 morale bonus on melee attack and damage rolls. The mustelidal can leave this state as a free action only after reducing an enemy to 0 hit points or fewer or when there are no enemies in the mustelidal's line of sight.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Tenacious warriors, mustelidals are the protectors of the good and neutral burrowing creatures of the universe, fending off such evil underground threats as neothelids, purple worms, and shaitans. These agathions are difficult to kill and see defeat in battle as little more than an annoying roadblock delaying their eventual victory.  Mustelidals look like humanoid badgers with black fur and a white stripe running from the crowns of their heads all the way down their backs. They often wear open yet loose-fitting clothing that shows off their toned physiques and allows them more freedom of movement in battle. They prefer to dress in deep, rich browns accented with warm colors, such as yellows and oranges. An average mustelidal stands 5-1/2 feet tall and weighs 180 pounds.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Mustelidals are fashioned from the souls of good-aligned mortals whose determination and perseverance kept them fighting long after they should have given in. The more times such a mortal has been resurrected in order to prolong its fight, the greater the chance that her soul is transformed into a mustelidal after finally receiving Pharasma's judgment. Just after they are \"born,\" mustelidals are eager to return to the Material Plane and engage in battle with the forces of evil.  When in a conflict, mustelidals rely on their natural defenses a bit too much, often getting in over their heads  and attacking large throngs of enemies or foes who eclipse them in size. In such situations, mustelidals tap into a well of courage that usually allows them to survive against all odds. These agathions use their ability to summon Large earth elementals only to distract their foes at the start of combat or in dire circumstances when the mustelidals need a way to cover their escape.  At the end of a protracted conflict, mustelidals burrow into the nearby dirt or use their <i>meld into stone</i> spell-like ability to allow their regeneration to restore them to full health. They also take advantage of their poison purge ability at this time if any toxins are coursing through their blood. If the mustelidals weren't victorious in the previous fight, they use their skills to track down the surviving foes to attempt to finish the job.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Because of mustelidals' unwillingness to back down from a fight, other types of agathions often use them as personal bodyguards, especially when traveling to other planes. Those with crucial missions frequently bring along a small retinue of mustelidals, though they must convince the badger-headed outsiders that they will be face a fair challenge; mustelidals are uninterested in wasting their talents against foes they can defeat without any effort. Occasionally, mustelidals are tasked with protecting a good-aligned outsider or a particularly important mortal. Mustelidals consider such a duty sacrosanct, and never abandon their charges when things get dangerous, not even to chase down an enemy to finish it off-while mustelidals enjoy fighting, they are clever enough to recognize that an apparent retreat may simply be an ambush in disguise.  When not protecting charges, mustelidals prefer to remain in burrowed dens, letting the cool, musty smell of soil fill their nostrils. They enjoy claustrophobic spaces and darkness, and often react violently to intruders who threaten their solitude with either their  or light. In other contexts, however, mustelidals are quite friendly, if a bit intense. They tend to speak in brief sentences and their laughs, which rarely occur, are short, staccato bursts. The condition of a mustelidal's fur often indicates how long it has been idle; one with dirt clumped and matted in its coat hasn't been in a fight in weeks or months. A mustelidal who has spent some time outside of Nirvana is much more freshly groomed.  Of all the races on the Material Plane, mustelidals have a certain fondness for gnomes. This may be because the two races share the ability to <i>speak with animals</i>, giving them both an appreciation of the natural world-or perhaps because mustelidals appreciate the way gnomes fight so hard to stave off the Bleaching, despite its seeming inevitability. Whatever the reason, a mustelidal sometimes forms a strong attachment with a particular gnome, rescuing him from fatal situations but otherwise content simply to observe his antics. Many campfire tales have been told about gnomes who have garnered these literal guardian angels.  <br /><strong>Calling a Mustelidal</strong><br />  Mustelidals are among the more powerful outsiders that can be called with <i>greater planar ally</i>. Although they do not need to eat, they enjoy the taste of honey, and each 8-ounce jar included in the material components of the spell counts as 200 gp worth of offerings. A mustelidal will eagerly accept the task of watching over a worthy person, halving the payment requested, though such tasks require a specific time frame and cannot be open-ended. Mustelidal protectors are often willing to lay down their lives to ensure the people in their care survive whatever dangers prompted them to employ the agathions' services in the first place. Particularly zealous mustelidals have been known to check in on their former charges from time to time, even years after the terms of their original agreement ended, offering their services again. While they require a new agreement to serve the mortal again, they can be very persuasive, and former charges who find themselves in perpetual danger may employ the same mustelidal a dozen or more times over the course of their lives, so long as the threats that the agathions are defending against present suitable challenges.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Hells_Vengeance.jpg","_id":"uuA5NnsFIDqiMpK9"}

The dragon uses his sacred breath weapon on the first round of combat and as often as possible thereafter, and is fond of using Vital Strike with his corrupting touch attack. As a ghost, Parnoneryx can't use some of his feats (Improved Critical [claw], Multiattack, and Power Attack), nor can he heal himself with his cure spells due to his undead state, but these limitations serve to focus his tactics rather than to cripple them.</p><p><strong>Morale </strong>Parnoneryx fights until destroyed.</p></div><hr /><div><p><strong>STATISTICS</strong></p></div><hr /><div><p><strong>Str </strong>-, <strong>Dex </strong>10, <strong>Con </strong>-, <strong>Int </strong> 20, <strong>Wis </strong>21, <strong>Cha </strong>28</p><p><strong>Base Atk </strong>+18; <strong>CMB </strong>+20; <strong>CMD </strong>39 (43 vs. trip)</p><p><strong>Feats </strong>Alertness, Critical Focus, Extend Spell, Improved Critical (bite), Improved Critical (claw), Iron Will, Multiattack, Power Attack, Vital Strike</p><p><strong>Skills </strong>Diplomacy +30, Fly +25, Heal +26, Knowledge (arcana) +26, Knowledge (local) +26, Knowledge (nobility) +26, Knowledge (religion) +26, Perception +38, Sense Motive +30, Spellcraft +26, Stealth +0, Swim +29</p><p><strong>Languages </strong>Celestial, Common, Draconic</p><p><strong>SQ </strong>haunted scales</p></div><hr /><div><p><strong>SPECIAL ABILITIES</strong></p></div><hr /><div><p><strong>Ghost Fangs (Su)</strong> Since Parnoneryx's ghost maintains a powerful link to his increasingly befouled head, the ghost retains a bite attack. The attack roll is modified by the dragon's Charisma modifier, the fangs deal force damage, and the damage is modified by 1-1/2 times his Charisma modifier. An evil creature that takes damage from Parnoneryx's ghost fangs must succeed at a DC 28 Will save or be nauseated with guilt for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting effect, and the save DC is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Haunted Scales (Su)</strong> Parnoneryx's ghostly scales shimmer and shine with golden energy, granting the ghost a +10 sacred bonus to his Armor Class.  </p><p><strong>Instant Spellcasting (Su)</strong> Once per day, Parnoneryx can cast up to 6 levels of spells he knows as a free action as he manifests, so long as Parnoneryx is the only target of these spells. Typically, Parnoneryx uses this ability to cast <i>eagle's splendor</i>, <i>mage armor</i>, <i>mirror image</i>, and <i>shield</i> on himself.  </p><p><strong>Rejuvenation (Ex)</strong> Parnoneryx's ghost can be put to rest in two ways. First, if the <i>tathlum</i> is successfully completed  Parnoneryx's ghost cannot be rejuvenated and his soul becomes trapped within the weapon until it is used, at which point the dragon's corrupted soul helps to power the resulting devastation before being banished to its destiny in the Great Beyond. Alternatively, if the dragon's severed head is reunited with whatever remains of his body and a cleric of Iomedae casts <i>hallow</i> upon them, Parnoneryx's ghost is released to the afterlife and his head can no longer be used to create a <i>tathlum</i>.  </p><p><strong>Sacred Breath Weapon (Su)</strong> Parnoneryx retains a fiery breath weapon, but it is infused with his righteous fury and bolstered by energies from Heaven itself. He can use this breath weapon once every 1d4 rounds. Damage caused by this breath weapon feels like scorching fire, but the damage is pure sacred energy and is not subject to energy resistance. An evil creature that takes damage from Parnoneryx's sacred breath weapon must also succeed at a DC 28 Will save to avoid being nauseated with guilt for 1 round; this nausea effect is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Hells_Vengeance.jpg","_id":"vUFoTY3d631nAjQ6"}
